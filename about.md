Established in 2002 by Joey Day, this is an exercise in critical thinking and writing about Christian theology, apologetics, technology, software engineering, web development, ramen noodles, and whatever other topics strike my fancy.

## About the author

In 2008 he got a MacBook and an iPhone and hasn’t looked back. He types on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" title="Dvorak-Dealey “Simplified” Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard</a> (<a href="http://papers.jday.co/view/dvorak" title="“The Myth of Dvorak” by Joey Day">but you shouldn’t</a>) and has been known to dabble in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" title="Double-entry bookkeeping">double-entry bookkeeping</a> (seriously). Since 2012 he has made his living engineering software on the <a href="http://servicenow.com" title="ServiceNow">ServiceNow</a> platform, at first for a higher-ed non-profit and more recently for a mortgage company.[^1]

Sometimes he writes about Mormonism, but he tries his best to treat the subject with candor and fairness.
