Hallelujah! (Is that how you spell it?) I’m learning HTML and it’s about time! Consequently, the site is under some MAJOR construction. I’m using a text editor called NoteTab. It has a few features Notepad doesn’t, but all in all it is a simple text editor.

I’m using the old files for ideas, but other than content, I’m starting from scratch. The bad thing is it may take me forever to rebuild everything. The good thing is that everything you see here has been made by yours truly, with my bare hands! This may not be exciting to many of you, but this is a major accomplishment for me. I have previously used Microsoft Publisher, which is great for making nice looking pages, but horrible at generating clean source code. The deeper I got into that, the more it just became a big pain in the butt.

So here we are! I hope everyone who visits will keep coming back. I should have a bunch of cool stuff posted soon.{% include endmark.html %}
