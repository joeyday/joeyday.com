I got an invitation to Google Wave today (thanks, Cory!), so I’ve been playing around with it a bit. One of the default welcome messages that popped into my shiny new account included the following YouTube video. It’s a good overview of the system, and much shorter than the original 80-minute presentation, so I thought I would share it with you all here.

<object height="264" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/p6pgxLaDdQw&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/p6pgxLaDdQw&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed></object>

Right now I only have three contacts with Wave accounts, none of whom I really collaborate with much, so I don’t know if I’ll get much use out of the system early on. If anybody out there has a Google Wave account and wants to chat, [click here to see my address](http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01ZJ8R8wEmecFD5vMfC5Zrdw==&c=usNTa0j00YAqF7D87VA8uFJkNf7OffNCBQ3AepEhhe8= "Reveal this e-mail address"). Oh, and you, my dear readers, will be the first to know if/when I’m allowed to invite other people to the party. Stay tuned. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
