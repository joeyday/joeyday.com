Version 2.5 of the LDS Linker plugin for WordPress is now available from the WordPress plugin repository. Version 2.5 adds support for using en-dashes in passage references (hooray for typography!). Additionally, you can now cancel the linking of any passage reference by preceding it with an exclamation mark. This is mostly useful for when you accidentally trigger a reference link where you don’t want one, i.e., “the !Omni 2 digital camera is an improvement over the popular !Omni 1.” Lastly, you can now set the hyperlinks to open in a new window if you prefer. Version 2.5 also fixes a number of bugs related to how certain characters, such as ampersands, en-dashes, and em-dashes, can be encoded.

- You may download the plugin here: [lds-linker.2.5.zip](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/lds-linker.2.5.zip)
- For additional information, frequently asked questions, and a complete change log, see the [LDS Linker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lds-linker/) page at the WordPress Plugin Directory.

Here’s some background for those who don’t know what I’m talking about: the LDS Linker plugin for WordPress changes any Latter-day Saint scripture reference in a blog post into a hyperlink pointing to the appropriate passage in the Internet Edition of the LDS Scriptures. It recognizes references whether the book name is written out or shortened using the [standard abbreviations](http://scriptures.lds.org/helps/abbrvtns).

Here are some examples:

> Moro 10:3-5 is a scripture mastery verse. Other scripture mastery verses include Mosiah 4:30, D&amp;C 130:22-23, and JS-H 1:15-20. I have Articles of Faith 1:1-13 memorized—how ’bout you?

A big thanks goes out to those who’ve helped me improve the code. Are *you* using LDS Linker? Please [let me know](/contact) what you think. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
