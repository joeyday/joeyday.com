I’m not sure why, exactly, but I’ve had this hymn on my mind a lot lately.

> #### Lead, Kindly Light
> 
> by John Newton
> 
> Lead, kindly light, amid th’ encircling gloom,  
>  Lead Thou me on;  
> The night is dark and I am far from home;  
>  Lead Thou me on;  
> Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see  
> The distant scene; one step enough for me.
> 
> I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou  
>  Should lead me on;  
> I loved to choose and see my path; but now  
>  Lead Thou me on!  
> I loved the garish day, and spite of fears,  
> Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years!
> 
> So long Thy Power hast blest me, sure it still  
>  Will lead me on;  
> O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till  
>  The night is gone,  
> And with the morn those angel faces smile  
> Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile! ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
