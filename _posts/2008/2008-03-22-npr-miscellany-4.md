I’ve been using \[LibraryThing\] to catalog my books since September 2005. *[All Things Considered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Considered)* on NPR recently featured LibraryThing in a story called “[Web Sites Let Bibliophiles Share Books Virtually](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88514715)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=ATC&showDate=20-Mar-2008&segNum=6)).

I especially love the intro to this story:

> You know that you’re a bibliophile if you check out peoples’ bookshelves when you visit their homes, if you never pass a used bookstore without going in, or if you have a giant wishlist on Amazon.com.

That fits me to a tee. If it fits you, you owe it to yourself to check out LibraryThing! ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
