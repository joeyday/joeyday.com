The lyrics of this song struck me as particularly beautiful last night:

> #### How Deep the Fatherâ€™s Love For Us
> 
> by Stuart Townend
> 
> How deep the Fatherâ€™s love for us,  
> How vast beyond all measure  
> That He should give His only Son  
> To make a wretch His treasure
> 
> How great the pain of searing loss,  
> The Father turns His face away  
> As wounds which mar the chosen One,  
> Bring many sons to glory
> 
> Behold the Man upon a cross,  
> My sin upon His shoulders  
> Ashamed I hear my mocking voice,  
> Call out among the scoffers
> 
> It was my sin that held Him there  
> Until it was accomplished  
> His dying breath has brought me life  
> I know that it is finished
> 
> I will not boast in anything  
> No gifts, no power, no wisdom  
> But I will boast in Jesus Christ  
> His death and resurrection
> 
> Why should I gain from His reward?  
> I cannot give an answer  
> But this I know with all my heart  
> His wounds have paid my ransom ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
