Every once in a while I hear a story on NPR that simply fascinates me. Yesterday it was a story on <cite>[All Things Considered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Considered)</cite> about a previously undiscovered portrait by [Van Gogh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh). This new painting was not “discovered” in the sense that it was found in the basement of some old museum. Rather, it was discovered hiding beneath the paint of another Van Gogh!

Apparently, Van Gogh had reused a canvas by painting a new painting over the top of an old one, and scientists used a new x-ray technique to see what the painting underneath looks like. They were even able to determine the colors of paint by analyzing the chemical makeup. Listen to the story and watch the accompanying video to see how they did it: “[Experts Uncover A Painting Van Gogh Covered Up](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93209918)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/player/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=93209918) and [watch](http://www.npr.org/templates/player/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=93209918&m=93210085)). ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
