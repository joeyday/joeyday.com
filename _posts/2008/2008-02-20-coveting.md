Okay, so I just checked out screenshots and Quicktime movies of [xScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope) (hat tip: [Stopdesign](http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2008/02/20/xscope-2.html)), and I’m really wishing I had a Mac right about now.

[![Apple Macbook (white)](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/macbook_white.png)](http://www.apple.com/macbook)

Other reasons I want a Mac include (but are certainly not limited to): [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/), [Quicksilver](http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver), and [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) or [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/)—no need to toss any of my Windows software! Add to this the simply stunning hardware and UI (visually and intuitively) not to mention the fact that Apple is widely known for their general designer-friendlyness (be they of the web, graphic, or video kind), and I’m really salivating.

[![Sony Vaio (wenge)](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/vaio_wenge.png)](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665293692)

Except, I’m torn. I also love [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). I love the idea of free (as in freedom) software and am in particular agreement with Mark Pilgrim about [proprietary file formats](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks), and Mac is honestly no different from PC in this regard. Plus, I recently found [the perfect machine](http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&langId=-1&productId=8198552921665293692) to run Ubuntu. The price is right, the specs are more than enough, and the color and texture make me think Ubuntu would be right at home. From a hardware standpoint, I could see myself enjoying this computer as much as I would enjoy a Macbook.

I’ve been coveting laptops for a couple years now, and it may be another year before I finally get me one, but I’m dreading having to make the final decision between Apple and Ubuntu. What should I do? ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
