I’m looking for someone to create a simple original graphic to be used as a logo/icon for a web-application I coded. I think the requirements I have in mind could be achieved by an experienced vector artist in an hour or two, tops. I know I’ve gotta have at least one friend or reader out there who’s up to this task. Let me know if you’re interested (and name your price if you’re so inclined) either in the comments or via my \[contact\] form and I’ll shoot you more details in an email.

Thanks. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
