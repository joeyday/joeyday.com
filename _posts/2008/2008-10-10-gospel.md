I have just finished listening to the second (and most recent) sermon in an excellent new series being preached by [Pastor John Piper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Piper_(theologian)) of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It’s an expository series that will take an entire year to go verse by verse through the whole Gospel of John. The first two sermons have been fantastic, and I would encourage—no, it needs to be a stronger word than that: exhort? urge. impel!—you, whoever you are, to watch, read, or listen to them yourself.

To that end, here is a link to the series: [The Gospel of John](http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/BySeries/86/). I’d love to chat with you about these sermons, so please please leave a comment if you do check them out. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
