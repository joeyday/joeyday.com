In a manner of speaking, yes. I’ve been following [your blog](http://wlair.wordpress.com/), and I almost mentioned in my earlier post that you’re having your own adventures in waking up. It sounds like you’re doing well, so I hope you can keep it up!

I believe the last time I blogged about this was [day 21](http://joeyday.com/2006/09/02/adventures-in-waking-up-day-21), and if memory serves I stopped on day 30-some-odd. I spent about a month off, after which I made a valiant second attempt (I vaguely remember blogging about the second attempt, but can’t seem to find it now), which lasted again about a month, and now, of course, it’s been over a year.

I really miss having that extra hour or so in the mornings to get things done, so I’d really like to get back in the swing of it. I’m not going to get cocky about it this time, though. I was getting up at 5:20 am back then, but this time around I’m going to do 6:00 am at the earliest.

This morning when I woke up to feed the cat, I honestly thought about staying up, but decided to crawl back into bed anyway. Tonight I’m purposely leaving tomorrow’s lunch unprepared so I’ll have to get up and do that. Hopefully that will be enough motivation. Wish me luck! ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
