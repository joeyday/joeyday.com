Well, my [“I ♥ Mormons” mug](/2005/10/12/an-open-question) arrived in the mail sometime in mid-October and I’ve been keeping it on my desk at work. As some here had predicted, it has indeed been a conversation starter. It certainly added a fun bit of character to my workspace and none of my LDS co-workers were offended by it (or at least none admitted to being offended).

Unfortunately, this morning as I was walking to the break room to fill it with coffee, I fumbled and dropped it on the floor in the hallway. It shattered into two large halves and a dozen smaller shards. I casually remarked to one of my Mormon friends that this may have been a sign from God that I should stop loving Mormons, to which he smartly replied that it was more likely a sign that I should stop drinking coffee. Touché.
