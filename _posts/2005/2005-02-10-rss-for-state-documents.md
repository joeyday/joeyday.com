I got an interesting announcement from the “Salt Lake City Weblogger Meetup”:http://blog.meetup.com/144/ in my email yesterday. Apparently, Utah is one of only three states using RSS to circulate official state domuments. The email says it better than I could:

bq.. Hello everyone,

I just want to invite others to come out for the webloggers meetup this next Wednesday, February 16th. Ken Hansen, a member of our group, just came back from Washington D.C. where they discussed about the use of RSS in government. I invited him to share this information on our next meetup. Please come! Here’s  
what he had to say:

*Representatives from the government agencies responsible for publishing administrative rules around the country met in Washington D.C. on Feb 4 through 6. The session that sparked the greatest level of discussion focused on the use of RSS  
feeds as a method of providing notice to the public. The states currently using RSS in relation to regulatory information include Delaware, Rhode Island, and Utah.*

*The Utah Division of Administrative Rules is currently experimenting with RSS is several ways. First, the Division has created blogs for its “newsletter”:http://rulesnews.utah.gov/ and the “Governor’s Executive Documents”:http://execdocnews.utah.gov/. Second, the Division has used a categorical feed of its newsletter, and a feed available from the Legislature’s site to generate a “legislative update web page”:http://www.rules.utah.gov/law/legis.htm. Third, the Division is experimenting with several notification feeds:*

\* *“rules.utah.gov/rss/filings.xml”:http://www.rules.utah.gov/rss/filings.xml*  
\* *“rules.utah.gov/rss/emergencyrules.xml”:http://www.rules.utah.gov/rss/emergencyrules.xml*  
\* *“rules.utah.gov/rss/hearings.xml”:http://www.rules.utah.gov/rss/hearings.xml*  
\* *“rules.utah.gov/rss/filings-govt.xml”:http://www.rules.utah.gov/rss/filings-govt.xml*

*I am open for suggestions that might improve our effort.*

*— Ken*

p. This simultaneously makes me feel proud to be a Utahn and bad for not attending the Meetups.
