\[ContentWatch\] has redesigned its website. The design is similar to their last one with some nice graphical improvements. The real reason I’m writing this is to point out what’s under the hood. For the first time, ContentWatch’s website is running on strict XHTML using CSS for both design and layout.

At the time of this writing I see 5 unescaped ampersands keeping the page from validating, but everything else looks great. I should mention that some of the inside pages haven’t been updated to the new tableless design yet, but I’m assuming they’re working on that.

Nice work, ContentWatch. Way to go!
