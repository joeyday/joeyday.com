Well, smack me up the side of my head with a rubber tuna fish. Jordan over at swirlee.org has found what I think may be “the best way to keep track of a wish list”:http://www.swirlee.org/2005/01/06/a-delicious-wish-list/ using \[del.icio.us\]. It’s so devilishly simple I’m not sure why hundreds of people haven’t done it before.

After ranting about the inadequacies of both Amazon and Froogle, Jordan has this to say:

bq.. Having recently fallen in love with, and having rapidly become entirely dependent upon, del.icio.us, I believe it may be the solution.

The proof-of-concept is easy: when you find an item, click on your del.icio.us bookmarklet, add the â€œwishlistâ€? tag, and thatâ€™s it, youâ€™ve got a wishlist.

p. I think I’ll start doing this right away.

Incidentally, Jordan recently redesigned his site. I’m a little flattered because he seems to have copied my idea of using similar words for sidebar titles. I, of course, use verbs that have been changed into nouns with the “-ation” ending; Jordan is using adverbs. Maybe he didn’t realize he was copying me at all, but if he was I can only say that imitation is the best form of flattery. He’s also added a del.icio.us link list using the same method I use, though he seems to have actually made it work (imagine that!). Kudos on your redesign, Jordan.
