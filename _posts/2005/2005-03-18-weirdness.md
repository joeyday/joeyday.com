I can only assume this happened when I upgraded to WordPress 1.5, but three of my old entries somehow lost their “publish” status. Instead of going into “draft” status, they simply had no status at all and ended up floating around in the ether. I was able to fix it by manually editing the SQL table. If you’ve upgraded to 1.5 recently, you may want to go back and see if you’re missing a few entries.
