<div class="lpic">[![Upgrade to Firefox 1.5!](http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/products/firefox/upgrade_1_5_125x125r.jpg "Upgrade to Firefox 1.5!")](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=5005&t=197)</div>[Firefox 1.5](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=5005&t=1) was officially released on Tuesday and has already received some rave reviews. I’ve been using it in various beta and release candidate stages for over a month now and absolutely love it. Mozilla has really outdone themselves with this release.

If you’ve been using 1.0+ it’s important that you upgrade to keep yourself safe from ever-increasing security threats. The new auto-updater in 1.5+ will ensure that you always have the latest version, but the upgrade from 1.0+ to 1.5 is still a manual process.

Never heard of Firefox? There’s never been a better time to get acquainted. What are you waiting for?
