I think I’m officially addicted to memes.

I just found this great site called \[43 Things\]. It’s another of those social sites like \[del.icio.us\] and \[Flickr\]. At 43 Things you list your long- and short-term goals and then track your own progress. You can also find other people who are working toward the same goals and enlist or offer help.

A while back I started compiling a list of 100 life goals. Last night I copied some things from that list onto 43 Things. Some of my goals are fanciful, but many are serious things I’d like to acheive.

Now to find a place to display “my 43 Things list”:http://www.43things.com/people/view/joeyday here on my blog…
