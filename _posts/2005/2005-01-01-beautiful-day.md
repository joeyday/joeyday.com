I’m writing this post early in the morning on December 31, 2004. If I’ve set the timestamp correctly, it shouldn’t appear on the site until just as I’m saying “I do.” I’m quite positive, though at this moment I can only imagine, that I’ll be having the best day of my life.

Janene, I’m so glad we’ve come to this wonderful point in our lives and in our relationship. I’ve had so much fun being your sweetheart for the last three and a half years. It’s hard to imagine things going up from here, but I have no doubt they will. We’ve only scratched the surface of what lies ahead. I’m so excited to experience my life together with you.

Congratulations Mrs. Day. No offense to any of my relatives, but you’re the most beautiful Day I’ve ever known. Welcome to the family. I love you!
