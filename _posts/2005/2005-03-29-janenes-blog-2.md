I installed a copy of \[WordPress\] on my wife’s website a couple weeks ago. Since then she’s been thinking a lot about what she wants to blog about. I don’t think she’s arrived at any conclusions, yet, but at least she got the ball rolling today.

Please give a warm blogosphere welcome to my lovely wife over at “Janene’s Blog”:http://www.janeneday.com.
