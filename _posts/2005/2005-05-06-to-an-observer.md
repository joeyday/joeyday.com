First off, thank you for taking the time to “comment”:http://www.joeyday.org/2005/03/29/mormon-literature#comment-361 on my site. I’m sorry your comment wasn’t immediately posted on the site; that probably didn’t seem very nice of me. You chose to comment on a rather old post, and I’ve enabled moderation on everything older than 30 days to prevent blog spamming. Your comment went into a queue where I had to approve it before it showed up. I’m not trying to censor anyone, and to prove it I published your comment.

I’m afraid you may have misinterpreted many of my statements here. If that’s the case, I’m truly sorry. I’d like the opportunity to explain myself and would love to catch up with an old friend, but I don’t want to do so here where everyone can read it (as you said, these are personal and private matters). Unfortunately, you didn’t provide any identification or contact information. If you’d like to discuss these things, please email me again and let me know how we can get in touch. Thanks.
