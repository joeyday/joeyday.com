<div class="rpic">![I ♥ Mormons mug](/images/heartmug.png)</div>I just bought an “I ♥ Mormons” mug from the [“I Heart” Shop](http://www.cafepress.com/iheartshop) at [CafePress.com](http://www.cafepress.com). I’m planning to keep it on my desk at work. I have a mug there now which I regularly drink coffee out of.

Whether you’re Mormon or not, would you be uncomfortable with me keeping this new mug on my desk? Why or why not?
