It’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten how fun it is to upgrade my browser. Sure, we’ve had the security updates, but there’ve really been no new features for almost a year.

\[Mozilla Firefox\] 1.5 Beta 1 changes all that with a slew of new bells and whistles, including a super-simple “Clear Private Data” dialog, better popup blocking, drag and drop re-orderable tabs, quicker back and forward navigation, and a shiny new automatic update system.

Additional updates include better support for CSS2 and CSS3, support for scalable vector graphics and JavaScript 1.6, and improved accessibility for screen readers. Especially spiffy are the pretty new error pages. No longer will modal message boxes alert you of broken pages and nonexistent domains.

I’m mildly dissappointed that several of my extensions haven’t yet been updated:

\* <del datetime="2005-09-13T22:02:01+00:00">ForecastFox</del>  
\* <del datetime="2005-09-13T22:02:01+00:00">HTML Validator (based on Tidy)</del>  
\* Stop-or-Reload Button  
\* <del datetime="2005-09-13T22:02:01+00:00">IE View</del>  
\* ReloadEvery  
\* <del datetime="2005-09-19T15:44:32+00:00">All-in-One Gestures</del>  
\* <del datetime="2005-09-19T15:41:17+00:00">BBCode</del>  
\* Timestamp  
\* <del datetime="2005-09-13T22:02:01+00:00">Web Developer</del>  
\* Wikipedia

All-in-all, though, this is a great release. I can’t wait until it comes out of beta.
