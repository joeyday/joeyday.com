I know I said my previous post would be the last thing I write about Mormonism for a while, but I can’t pass up this opportunity. I watched most of conference this weekend and I’m wondering which talks inspired or interested people the most.

I was personally intrigued by Elder Russell M. Nelson’s talk about his wife and preparing to meet God. That’s certainly one I’ll study thoroughly when the transcripts get posted on Thursday. I’m also more than a little curious about the church’s new missionary program, <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite>, announced by Richard G. Scott.

Anyone else have a favorite talk you plan to study in more detail later?
