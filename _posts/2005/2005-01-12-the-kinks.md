As I see it, here are the kinks that need to be worked out of this blog before I’ll be satisfied with it:

\* Bring back the *Edification* sidebar (I like the *Interpolation* sidebar, so *Edification* may have to be moved to the “Info”:http://www.joeyday.org/info page).  
\* <del>Find some way to implement Amazon links (WP-Amazon plugin?).</del>  
\* <del>Links to scriptures:</del>  
\*\* <del>Bible Gateway (with Scripturizer?)</del>.  
\*\* <del>LDS.org (not sure how to do this, yet).</del>  
\* <del>Figure out a better color for `code` elements.</del>

As I notice more things I’ll be adding them to this list. As things get finished I’ll be striking them from this list. Stay tuned.
