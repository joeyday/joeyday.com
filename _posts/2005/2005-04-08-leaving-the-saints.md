<div class="lpic">[![Leaving the Saints : How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0609609912.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0609609912%2526location=/o/ASIN/0609609912%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")</div>I have in my hands a copy of Martha Nibley Beck’s book, <cite>[Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0609609912%2526location=/o/ASIN/0609609912%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")</cite>. When I noticed it on the shelf last night at the Christian bookstore where I work, I immediately pulled it and told the owner of the store we probably shouldn’t be selling it. I’m not sure why I never warned him about this book. Somehow I just assumed it would never show up.

Nevertheless, here it is sitting in front of me. I told the owner I would look it over at home and let him know what I think about it. I’m 99% certain I’m going to tell him to send it straight back to the distributor.

I thought about actually reviewing it here, but I don’t think that’s necessary. It’s a bunch of hogwash from a new age “life coach” with repressed memories. It propagates every stereotype of Mormonism you’ve ever heard and even starts a few new ones. Even if all it’s vitriol were true, it’s certainly not Christian, so what place does it have in a Christian bookstore?
