I’m playing with my color scheme today. If you think it looks like puke, wait a few minutes and refresh the page. I should be done sometime this afternoon. Thanks for your patience.

*Edit @ 3:06 pm: Done. I was going for a crisp, clean, bright look. What do you think?*

*Edit @ 10:32 pm: Depending on which computer I load it at, I’m still seeing the old beige colored sidebar. You may need to clear your cache or do a Ctrl + F5 to see the new colors. If the sidebar is white, you’ve got it.*
