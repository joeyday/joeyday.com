I just added a new public page to “my wiki”:http://www.joeyday.net. It’s the rules to my favorite card game, “Mao”:http://www.joeyday.net/index.php/Mao. I played this game with a few friends the other night and thought I’d pull these rules out and dust them off. I’ve had them typed up for a while in a Word document, and thought it would be great to upload them here so others can enjoy the game. Have fun!
