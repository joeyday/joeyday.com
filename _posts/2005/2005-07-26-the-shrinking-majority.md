The Salt Lake Tribune ran an interesting series of articles starting Sunday and ending today. If current trends continue, so the series claims, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the longstanding majority religion in Utah, will be outnumbered in the state sometime around 2030. The series also highlights a few families in and out of the church and has some interesting things to say about worldwide LDS church statistics.

If you live in Utah or are otherwise interested in these issues, the series is worth a read.
