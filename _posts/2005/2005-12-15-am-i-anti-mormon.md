For some time now I’ve been wondering (and I dare say worrying) whether or not others might justifiably label me an anti-Mormon. I came across a definition today that allayed my concern somewhat, but I want to post it here and see if people agree with it.

From the pamphlet <cite>[Defending the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — A Reference Guide](http://www.shields-research.org/Books/Defending.pdf)</cite> by Wayne D. Arnett (a joint publication of [FAIR](http://www.fairlds.org) and [SHIELDS](http://www.shields-research.org)):

bq. **Anti-Mormon:** One who opposes, attempts to find fault with, and passes judgment on the beliefs and faith of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ by way of lectures, pamphlets, books, films, etc.

So, do you agree with the definition? Whether you agree with the definition or not, would you label me an anti-Mormon? Why or why not? Don’t be afraid to be brutal.
