I’ve installed the excellent “Spread Firefox WordPress plugin”:http://www.martinet.nl/wp-site/spread-firefox-wordpress-plugin and I’m having a lot of fun with it. I’ve used it to add a fairly unobtrusive bar across the top of my site (it only appears in Internet Explorer) to alert IE users to the inferiority of their browser. It shouldn’t get in anyone’s way, though I hope it encourages a few folks to switch.
