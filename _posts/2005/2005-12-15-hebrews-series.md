Some of you may know Janene and I have been involved with a mid-week Bible study group for the past two or three years. The lady who originally organized and led the group moved to Georgia over a year ago, and in the absense of leadership our group has been meeting very sporadically since then. In order to kick-start things, the group has asked me to begin leading the studies.

As a group we’ve decided to start a study of the book of Hebrews, and I’ve consequently been studying the book as often as I get the chance. I taught the first part of the first study, [Hebrews Overview](http://www.joeyday.net/images/c/c2/Hebrews_Overview.pdf), a few weeks ago. For those interested in reading them, I’ll be posting them on [JoeyDay.net](http://www.joeyday.net) (see [Bible Studies](http://www.joeyday.net/index.php/Category:Bible_Studies)) and probably here as well.
