One of my favorite bloggers has “noticed the Homestar Runner Wiki”:http://blogs4god.com/linker/article.php?a=001881. MeanDean (Dean Peters) of “blogs4God.com”:http://www.blogs4god.com and “Heal Your Church Web Site”:http://www.healyourchurchwebsite.com comments:

bq. Ain’t technology grand?! Lookie what I found … the \[Homestar Runner Wiki\], a collaborative knowledge-base dedicated to the Homestar Runner Flash cartoons created by The Brothers Chaps. We are currently working on 900 articles. **COooool!**

Speaking of getting noticed… At the family Christmas party last December I ran into a cousin I haven’t seen for several years. He’s into computers like me (although he’s a lot smarter), so the subject naturally turned from computers to Firefox to the Firefox Wikipedia plugin. As we were talking about Wikipedia, I asked him if he’d ever heard of Homestar Runner. I was getting excited to tell him all about the Homestar Runner Wiki, but he beat me to it! He was the first person in real life to bring up the wiki before I did.

It’s fun having a website that gets noticed, though I shouldn’t take even a small percentage of the credit for that. Being a collaborative effort, it owes its success to the many members who’ve contributed hours and hours to make it what it is. It’s still fun to think that I kicked it all off though. In the words of MeanDean: **COooool!**
