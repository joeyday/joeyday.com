Upon hearing that <cite>Robots</cite> was more action-packed than most computer animated films, I was looking forward to another <cite>[The Incredibles](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005JN4W%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005JN4W%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")</cite>. Unfortunately, <cite>Robots</cite> was a huge let-down.

To it’s credit, the movie had some fun characters. Robin Williams is good in just about everything he does, and his character, Fender, provided some much needed comic relief. Shamefully, nothing else in this film was funny.

The plot was sub-par and the characters were two-dimensional. The animators really pushed the envelope in terms of complexity on a lot of scenes, but that only served to make those scenes seem disjointed from the rest of the movie.

Unless you really love CG eye-candy and aren’t opposed to sitting through a crummy plot, my advice is to spend your money somewhere else.
