> There is a follow up book to “How Wide The Divide” called “The New Mormon Challenge.”

<div class="alignleft">[![The New Mormon Challenge](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0310231949.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://amzn.com/0310231949/?tag=joeyday-20)</div>Terry, that’s one of my favorite books. I saw it more as a follow-up to <cite>[Mormon America](http://amzn.com/0061432954/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite>, but maybe I’m wrong, or maybe it’s both. In literature aimed at Mormonism, there is definitely a movement within Christianity away from vitriol and invective toward more scholarly material.

I believe there is enough error in Mormonism that there’s no need to make stuff up or sensationalize things. I didn’t read any “anti-Mormon” literature when I was in transition, and I honestly don’t think that material is effective at all.

My conversion happened as I read the Bible and compared and contrasted its message with the claims of Mormonism. I read a few “pro-Christian” books in the process. The few anti-Mormon books I skimmed through always made me feel like I was being attacked. I never had any interest in reading that. Once I found the LDS church to be false, there were a number of issues I had to grapple with, and books like <cite>[The New Mormon Challenge](http://amzn.com/0310231949/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> helped me do that without making me feel insulted for what I used to believe.

It’s my opinion that Evangelicals will move forward with Mormons only through honest dialogue and a focus on the good news of Christ—but I don’t think you need to be told that. You’ve already started an even-spirited dialogue with Steve in [another thread](/2004/09/24/a-case-for-amillennialism-part-1#comment-57). I hope you guys both learn something.
