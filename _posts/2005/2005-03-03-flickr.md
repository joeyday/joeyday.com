Well, I’ve gone and joined the internet craze that is \[Flickr\]. Feel free to snoop through “my photos”:http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeyday/. So far I’ve uploaded the same ones that are available at “janeneday.com”:http://www.janeneday.com, but in time I’ll be uploading actual wedding pictures. I’ve had at least one request and I intend not to dissappoint.

<div class="lpic">[![005_2](http://photos3.flickr.com/5821760_35691d2844_t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/joeyday/5821760 "005_2")</div>I’ve also installed a WordPress extension called “Flickit”:http://chancecube.com/flickit/. It allows me to post my Flickr images to my blog, like the one to the left.

Anyone else using Flickr out there? I’d love to see your photos, too. Post a link in the comments below.
