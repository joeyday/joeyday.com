I’ve accepted a position at my church to serve as the full-time intern to the youth pastor. It’s a paid position lasting 10 weeks during the summer. I’ve been considering a career in full-time ministry for some time now and I’m excited for the opportunity to see what it’s like firsthand. I hope God will use this experience to show me whether or not this is what I should be doing for the rest of my life.

My current employer, \[ContentWatch\], is keeping the door open for me to return in August when the internship ends. That’s a huge blessing and was the final straw for me in making the decision to do this. Janene is planning to quit her job at the end of the summer to start graduate school, so I’ll need good solid employment moving into the fall.

The internship will not pay as well as my current job, but we’ve had a few late wedding presents and other financial blessings this month. I’m confident the Lord will provide abundantly for us this summer. I’m truly grateful for all my blessings and hope to give back to the Lord this summer by serving Him and His people through this intership.
