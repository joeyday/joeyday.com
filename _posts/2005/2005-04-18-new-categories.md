I’m going to start filing posts under a couple of new category systems, the “five solas”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/five-solas/ and the “doctrines of grace”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/doctrines-of-grace/. I don’t think all my posts will fit under these categories, but the empty categories will help me brainstorm new topics and I think these will serve as positive ways to organize my thoughts.

#### The Five Solas

The five solas are five principles that sum up the doctrines of the reformation. They are:

\* “Sola scriptura”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/sola-scriptura — scripture alone  
\* “Solus Christus”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/solus-christus — Christ alone  
\* “Sola gratia”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/sola-gratia — grace alone  
\* “Sola fide”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/sola-fide — faith alone  
\* “Soli Deo gloria”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/soli-deo-gloria — glory to God alone

For more information, see the Wikipedia entry for “five solas”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five\_solas.

#### The Doctrines of Grace

The doctrines of grace are probably more popularly known as the five points of Calvinism. They are:

\* “Total depravity”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/total-depravity  
\* “Unconditional election”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/unconditional-election  
\* “Limited atonement”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/limited-atonement  
\* “Irresistable grace”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/irresistable-grace  
\* “Perseverance of the Saints”:http://www.joeyday.org/category/perseverance-of-the-saints
