Ever since I installed [MagpieRSS](http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/) on my server (it powers my \[del.icio.us\] sidebar links), the site loads a lot slower. I’m pretty sure it’s happening because Magpie’s caching isn’t enabled. I’d like to have caching anyway to prevent my site from overloading del.icio.us—not that it would with my piddly traffic, but it seems incredibly impolite to ping someone else’s server every time my site loads.

I’ve gone through the readme files and tried the steps outlined for setting up caching, but it doesn’t seem to be working correctly. If anyone knows anything (or can figure anything out) about MagpieRSS, please let me know. Thanks. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
