Holy cow! It’s late and I should go to bed, but the “Google Blog just announced”:http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/04/birds-eye-view.html that “Google Maps”:http://maps.google.com now has the ability to display satellite images in the same slick interface as it already delivers maps. Now you can have driving directions superimposed over actual images of the streets in your hometown.

In my mind, Google Maps already blew MapQuest out of the water, but this adds a whole new dimension of fun.
