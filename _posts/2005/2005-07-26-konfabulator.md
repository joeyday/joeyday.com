There’s a lot of buzz on the internet lately about something called [Konfabulator](http://www.konfabulator.com), so I downloaded it to check it out. Konfabulator used to cost a pretty penny, but was recently acquired by Yahoo! and is now free (as in free beer).

In a nutshell, Konfabulator is a framework upon which developers can create things called widgets. Widgets can be anything a developer wants them to be, but they’re generally simple objects like clocks, calendars, CPU load meters, and the like. I love the weather widget that comes pre-installed with Konfabulator and I’ve also found a simple desk calendar I like. You can also find remote controls for various media players and other programs.

I’ve enjoyed playing around with it today and would recommend it. It’s worth a quick look at least, considering it’s free.
