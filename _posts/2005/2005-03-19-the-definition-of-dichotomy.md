In response to <cite>“The Definition of Forgiveness”:http://www.joeyday.org/2005/02/14/the-definition-of-forgiveness</cite>, “B.P.”:http://www.joeyday.org/2005/02/14/the-definition-of-forgiveness#comment-78 said:

bq. You are correct that God commands us to forgive unconditionally, but He Himself sets conditions on His forgiveness. But you are INCORRECT to state that we Latter-Day Saints do not believe this way.

I apologize if you got confused. My statement was a little fuzzy. I did not mean to say that *I* believe “God commands us to forgive unconditionally, but He Himself sets conditions on His forgiveness.” I meant to say that *Mormons* believe that and I disagree with it. I personally believe there is only one kind of forgiveness. God expects us to forgive unconditionally, and he also forgives men without condition.

I have clarified my statement in the original post to better reflect what I meant to say. I added the clause, “According to Mormonism.”

B.P. said:

bq.. â€œMormons have two different definitions for forgivenessâ€¦â€?

With respect, youâ€™re wrong. Latter-Day Saints do NOT believe this. …

D&amp;C 64:10 states:

â€œI, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.â€?

That certainly points out the â€œdichotomyâ€? between what we as Godâ€™s children are expected to practice, and what the Lord with His perfect knowledge will do regarding forgiveness.

p. With all due respect, it seems to me you’re having trouble making up your mind. You say that Mormons don’t have two definitions of forgiveness, but then, almost in the same breath, you point out the obvious “dichotomy”. Can you please clarify this for me?
