A friend of mine contacted me over IM with a CSS question today. Through the course of the conversation, he introduced me to an insteresting resource: “pastebin”:http://www.pastebin.com.

The premise is simple. Need help troubleshooting a piece of code? Maybe you’ve been talking to a friend over IM or IRC and they want to see what you’re working on. Pasting the code into the IM window can be a little annoying. Instead, you can simply paste your code into pastebin and give your friend a link. They can edit the code and paste it back so you can see their suggested changes.

I took the liberty of stealing their script (they said I could) and installed it at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">paste.joeyday.com</span>. There are a few kinks to work out, but feel free to use it whenever you like.

*Edit April 18, 2005 @ 2:03 pm: I’ve taken my local installation of pastebin down because I wasn’t really using it.*
