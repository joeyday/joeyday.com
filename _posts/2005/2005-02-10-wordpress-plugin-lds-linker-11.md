*Notice: [A newer version of LDS Linker has been released](http://joeyday.com/to/lds-linker).*

Software is bound to have bugs, and my code is no exception (in fact, it’s probably buggier than most). After seeing my plugin in action on a few blogs, I noticed some D&amp;C references weren’t getting linked.

It seems that, by default, WordPress encodes ampersands with the `&` entity rather than the `&` entity I was expecting. My Textile 2 plugin uses `&`, so the problem never came up in my testing.

Without further ado, here’s the new version:

- Download: [lds-linker.1.1.zip](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/lds-linker.1.1.zip)

Again, don’t hesitate to submit your [feedback](/contact). ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
