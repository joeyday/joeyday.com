Microsoft has announced the official name of the Longhorn code-name project: [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.mspx).

One of the more exciting announcements (imho) is that six new fonts will ship with the OS. Assuming Vista gains widespread market-share, these will be the first new fonts in a long time to be acceptable for use on the web.

You can already download the fonts from various places on the net (I got them [here](http://test.uxevolutions.info/zoronax/entries/10)). They’re all pretty simple, but they’re a nice break from the same three or four fonts everyone’s used to seeing.
