If you’re subscribed to my \[del.icio.us\] bookmarks feed, I apologize for cluttering up your feedreader this morning. I think I added over 30 bookmarks to my del.icio.us list. Whew!

I just did some spring cleaning in my own feedreader — deleted a bunch of stuff, reorganized my folder hierarchy, etc. — and decided to finally compile a definitive list of the blogs I read. There’s some great stuff in there. Take a moment to peruse “my list of blogs”:http://del.icio.us/joeyday/blog.
