\[Firefox\] 1.0.2 was released about an hour ago. According to “Asa”:http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007795.html, it’s a “proactive update to fix a bug that makes users vulnerable to a buffer overflow in GIF image processing.”

It probably won’t show up on auto-update for a few days, so if you like being on the leading edge, you should download it from the web. Happy browsing!

*Edit @ 4:30pm: A friend here at work noticed the automatic update icon on his Firefox toolbar just now. Looks like they are pushing it today afterall.*
