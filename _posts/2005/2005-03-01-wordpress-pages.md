I’ve converted my “Info”:http://joeyday.com/info page into a WordPress “Page” (I also added a new paragraph about the wiki). Converting it required me to build a new `page.php` template, but that was relatively easy. I had fun adding custom fields to my pages so that each page I build can have its own title and tagline, following my “-ation” word and definition pattern. I also use a specific body id on each of my pages to facilitate styling the navbar, so that was put into a custom field as well.

With the help of a “slick plugin”:http://ryanduff.net/wp-plugins/wp-contactform, I’ve also created a “Contact”:http://joeyday.com/contact page. I’m really getting tired of spam email, and having a contact page allows me to pull all my email addresses off the site indefinitely.
