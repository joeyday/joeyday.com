I want to thank everyone for the great feedback I received from my previous post on “Mormon Literature”:http://www.joeyday.org/2005/03/29/mormon-literature. There was a lot of information provided, but it gives me a great place to start and answers some questions about what I should focus on if I want to get a balanced and clear picture of Mormon doctrine.

Following up on that post, I want to mention that “English transcripts”:http://lds.org/conference/sessions/display/0,5239,49-1-520,00.html of the 175th Annual General Conference are now available on the LDS church website.

Also on a related note, I ordered a copy of <cite>Preach My Gospel</cite> from the church distribution center. The “ldscatalog.com”:http://www.ldscatalog.com website was crawling along Saturday afternoon following Elder Scott’s announcement of the new resource, but I was able to get in and place my order late Saturday evening. I didn’t expect it to arrive so soon given the demand is probably high right now, but it arrived in the mail yesterday. It appears to be a very handy resource — to the point that I \_almost\_ wish I was a missionary again. There’s much more information provided than was ever a part of the six discussions. This book alone will give me much to read and study.
