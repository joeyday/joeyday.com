I’m upgrading the site to \[WordPress\] 1.5. I’ve hit some snags getting comments to work with the hacks I introduced in version 1.2. I’m trying to iron them all out, but in the mean time, please bear with me.

I may keep it set on the Kubrick theme (except when I’m testing things, of course) until I get my usual theme working correctly.
