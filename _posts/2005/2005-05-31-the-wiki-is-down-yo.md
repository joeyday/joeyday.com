bq. Looks like somebody tried to cramma-lamma Swiss Cake Rolls into the disk drive.

Ahem, well, I’ve been getting a few emails about the \[Homestar Runner Wiki\] being down this weekend. Don’t nobody panic. We’re not gone forever or anything.

The wiki has simply exceeded its bandwidth limit, which means too many people are visiting and the server can’t handle the traffic. The site should be up tomorrow at the start of the new month and we’ll most likely be moving it to a more powerful server sometime in the next few weeks.
