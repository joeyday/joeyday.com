Well, the crap’s been hittin’ the fan hard lately. Spammers have taken to a new trick: using trackback pings.

I’ve installed a couple plugins that are supposed to put all trackbacks and pingbacks (I had no idea there was a difference until about 5 minutes ago — remind me to look that up later) into my moderation queue. I get so few (read: zero) real trackbacks that I’m not too worried about making legitimate people wait a few hours.

If you’re interested, you can find the plugins I’m using at “MtDewVirus”:http://mtdewvirus.com/archives/2005/01/06/wordpress-plugins-trackback-and-pingback-moderation/.

Die evil spammers, die!
