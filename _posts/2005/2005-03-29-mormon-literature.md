This will be my last post on Mormonism for a while. I honestly never intended for this blog to center around Mormonism, but it’s a hard subject for me to avoid given my background and the concern I have for my friends and family.

The purpose of this post is to ask an honest question. I’m trying to learn all I can about Mormonism. In my statements here and elsewhere I’d like to portray LDS doctrine as accurately as I can without resorting to [ad hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) or [straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) arguments. To that end, I’m asking the LDS folks who read this blog to please recommend some positive reading material. I’m interested in reading the classics I never read before—preferably books that most Mormons would recognize and trust.

Since so many commenters claim that I don’t understand the Mormon concept of forgiveness, I’m currently reading <cite>[The Miracle of Forgiveness](http://amzn.com/0884944441/?tag=joeyday-20 "View product details at Amazon")</cite> by Spencer W. Kimball ((Being such an old book, I was worried that it may have fallen out of popularity, but I was encouraged by the clerk at Seagull Book &amp; Tape. When I brought it to the counter she told me she had just purchased herself a copy and was really enjoying it.)).

Other books on my list include:

- <cite>[Mormon Doctrine](http://amzn.com/0884940624/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> by Bruce R. McConkie
- <cite>[Answers to Gospel Questions](http://amzn.com/0877470049/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> by Joseph Fielding Smith
- <cite>[Believing Christ](http://amzn.com/1570089264/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> by Stephen E. Robinson
- <cite>[Following Christ](http://amzn.com/1573450596/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> by Stephen E. Robinson
- <cite>[The Plan of Salvation](http://amzn.com/1591560888/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite> by Matthew B. Brown

Are there any classics I’m leaving out ((In case anyone wants to recommend <cite>The Book of Mormon</cite>, I should mention that I’ve read a few times already and am currently a fourth of the way through it again.))? Any on the list above I should avoid? Especially any on the list above you’ve never heard of or know little about?

Thanks are offered in advance for any counsel provided.
