Janene and I had dinner last night at one of our favorite places, “Ab’s Drive-in”:http://local.google.com/local?q=abs+drive+in&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=G&amp;near=84119&amp;rl=1&amp;sc=1&amp;radius=0&amp;latlng=40690977,-111952964,17784051337607135689. I would recommend Ab’s to anyone with a stomach, and, no, I haven’t been paid to say that.

Ab’s signature meal is a Fat Boy burger with fries. Their burgers are excellent, but the fries are really where Ab’s shines. They leave the skin on the potatoes, giving them a homestyle taste, and their fry sauce simply has no equal. They use some secret ingredient to give the sauce a more glazed look and an amazing flavor.

If you live anywhere near Salt Lake City, you really should swing by Ab’s sometime. You won’t regret it. If you’re in the mood for some company, Janene and I would love to go with you. We’ve been talking about inviting friends for a while and just haven’t got around to it.
