<div class="lpic">[![I Made It!](http://photos11.flickr.com/13014546_eab844af61_t.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/76967796@N00/13014546 "I Made It!")</div>Janene graduated from University of Utah last week with a Bachelors of Science in Speech and Hearing Science. I just uploaded some photos ((Ironically, I’m wearing that same blue shirt and tie I always seem to wear in pictures. Cameras seem to be attracted to that ensemble. I have lots of other shirts, I swear.)) of the event to \[Flickr\] (you may have noticed them randomly appearing on the sidebar mixed in with our wedding pics). It’s easiest to view them using Flickr’s slick [slideshow](http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeyday/sets/316665/show/) feature.

Congratulations, Janene. I love you!
