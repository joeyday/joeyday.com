“\[“The Amazing Race 6″:http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing\_race6/\]” kicked off last night. I first started watching this show during “season 5”:http://joeyday.com/2004/07/11/amazing-race-5 this summer, and I highly recommend it. If you missed last season, now’s a good time to start watching!

The Amazing Race airs Tuesdays at 9:00 pm Eastern and Pacific.
