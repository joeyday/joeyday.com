Welcome to my new faith and theology weblog. I’ve been wanting to put this up for a while, and I’m excited to get started!  
  
Many of you reading this are probably already aware of my other blog, *“Joey Day : Avocation”:http://joeyday.com*, but if you’ve never been there, it may be worth a look. When I started my original blog (it wasn’t titled “Avocation” until recently), I wrote on every subject, but mostly the boring ins and outs of my daily routine. I’ve since refined the subject matter with a focus on tech-related topics.

I used to list prayer requests and talk about spiritual matters as well, but when I changed the subject matter, I also decided to split my “Avocation” from my “Foundation”, and the idea for *Joey Day : Foundation* was born. I reserved the domain a couple months ago, but I never got around to building it until now.

Stay tuned for more information (I’ll be putting up an Info page similar to the one on my Avocation blog).

\[Edit: Because the Theology category was empty, the category and all of it’s sub-categories were not displaying on my sidebar. As a temporary workaround, I’ve categorized this post as Theology to force these categories to display.\]
