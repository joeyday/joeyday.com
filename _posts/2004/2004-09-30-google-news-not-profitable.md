I read “an interesting article”:http://wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65106,00.html over at “Wired News”:http://www.wired.com yesterday. Apparently, Google News is facing some complex issues. I’ve been wondering for a while why it’s still considered beta even though it hasn’t changed much since I stumbled across it almost a year ago.

The answer is simple: it’s not generating any revenue for Google. Since they are culling their news from thousands of third-party sites who they are not contracted with, if they were to throw any advertising up they would probably be hit with a class-action copyright infringement lawsuit.

It’s really a shame, as I think their idea is an extremely good one. I’ve been using it as my only news source for several months now.
