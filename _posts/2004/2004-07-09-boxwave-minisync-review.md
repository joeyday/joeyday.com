Judging by the reaction I got from mentioning my latest purchase, I’m not sure anyone will be interested in this review, but I don’t want to go back on a promise, so here goes.

My “BoxWave miniSync”:http://www.boxwave.com arrived faster than I thought (only a few days after I posted my first entry about it). I’ve been using it now for a couple of weeks, and I’m very impressed.

The retractable cord makes for easy storage/portability, while the combination USB and power connectors make it very convenient to use. With the added car and wall plug adaptors, I can charge virtually anywhere. I don’t think my Palm has been lower than 75% battery strength for the last couple of weeks.

The cord itself is very thin and lightweight, but strong. BoxWave shows it holding up a couple of bricks on their website, and I have no doubt that’s for real. The connectors and the reel seem to be of high quality.

BoxWave offers the miniSync for just about every PDA model (Blackberry, Palm, Pocket PC, etc.). I would recommend them to anyone interested in a quick, easy hotsync-anywhere solution.
