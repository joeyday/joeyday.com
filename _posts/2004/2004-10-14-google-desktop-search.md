\[Google\] released a slick new tool this morning: “Desktop Search”:http://desktop.google.com. It allows you to search your own computer with the same speed and accuracy as a Google web search.

It requires a thin client installed on your computer, which adds a layered service-provider to your winsock and an icon to your tray. The service keeps a constant watch over your files, re-indexing as often as you make changes. With the client installed, a new “Desktop” item appears next to the familiar Web, Images, Groups, News, and Froogle options above the standard Google search box.

The desktop search indexes the entire contents of Outlook, Outlook Express, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files, along with transcripts of your AIM conversations. It also indexes all of your text files and your web history. On top of all that, it indexes your entire file system by filename.

Incidentally, \[ContentWatch\] has always had trouble with third-party winsock services, but the Google desktop search LSP seems fairly benign. ContentProtect is still filtering my Internet without a hitch. My guess is that the desktop search should be compatible with most firewall and antiviral software.
