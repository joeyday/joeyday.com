I haven’t made mention of any of the Firefox releases lately, because they’ve all been pretty trivial, but I suppose it’s worth mentioning that “Firefox 0.9.3”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox and “Thunderbird 0.7.3”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird have been released.

Get ’em while they’re hot, folks.
