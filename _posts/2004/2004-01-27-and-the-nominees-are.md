The 76th Annual Academy Awards are scheduled for February 29, 2004, and the [nominee list](http://www.oscar.com/nominees/nomineelist.html) was just released this morning. *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* was nominated for a whopping 11 Oscars!

I’m not sure how many nominations the first two LOTR movies got, but the winnings have been pretty sparse. *Fellowship* took in four academy awards (for cinematography, make-up, best original score, and visual effects) and *Two Towers* only took in two (for sound editing and visual effects).

So, it looks like *Return of the King* may be a shoe-in for visual effects (although it’s up against *Pirates of the Carribean*, so I’m not holding my breath), but will it get best picture? It did get the [Golden Globe award](http://www.hfpa.org/realtime.html) last week for best motion picture drama, along with three others (best directing, best original score, and best original song), so I think it’s got a fighting chance. Only time will tell…
