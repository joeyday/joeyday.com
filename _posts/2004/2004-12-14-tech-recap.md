It’s been a while since I’ve blogged, and many important things have happened in the tech world.

First off, “Thunderbird 1.0”:http://www.getthunderbird.com has been released. I haven’t noticed much in the way of new features since 0.7, but it seems to be extremely stable and sports a stylish new default theme (although that may have debuted in version 0.9, which I somehow completely skipped over).

In other \[Mozilla\] news, the “New York Times Firefox 1.0 ad is finally finished”:http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/8538. It should appear in the paper during the next week or so. I’ll definitely be picking me up a copy.

I may be the last one on the planet to have done so, but I discovered the \[Google Blog\] the other day. Unlike so many others on the web, I’m not even going to mention the new “Google Suggest”:http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en — wait, did I just mention it? Oh, well. Incidentally, my “Google Suggest number”:http://www.jerrykindall.com/2004/12/10\_google\_suggest\_number.asp is 7.0.1.

In other \[Google\] news, “Froogle”:http://www.froogle.com now lets users set up a shopping list and a public wish list. This is great for those random items \[Amazon\] doesn’t carry. If you’re thinking about getting me something for Christmas, be sure to check my new “Froogle wish list”:http://froogle.google.com/shoppinglist?a=SWL&amp;id=c5180a2fde6d5461dbbcff249566f23421e17.
