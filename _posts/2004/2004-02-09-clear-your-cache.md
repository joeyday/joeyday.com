I‚Äôve put up a new site theme for Valentine‚Äôs Day, but all the graphics and stylesheets kept the same names. If the logo graphic looks funny or if you are still seeing the blue background, try a hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5, which reloads all the graphics, ignoring anything that may already be in cache) or try clearing your cache altogether. Sorry for any inconvenience. üôÅ
