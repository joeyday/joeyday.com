A few days ago, I blogged the following:

bq.. **A Word of Advice**

Don’t lose your wallet. Ugh.

p. Yes, I was speaking from personal experience. On Thursday, December 9, I lost my wallet. Actually, it’s quite a bit more than just a wallet. It’s a small “zippered folio”:http://shopping.franklincovey.com/shopping/catalog/product2.jsp?navAction=push&amp;navCount=3&amp;id=prod114 (mine is actually blue, but the line has been discontinued and this is the only picture I can find online) that contains, in addition to my driver’s license and credit cards, my “palmOne Tungsten E”:http://palmone.com/us/products/handhelds/tungsten-e/.

Not only is the Palm itself worth $199 (of course, mine is worth less since it is used), but I also have a 512 MB Secure Digital card inside that I paid $100 for (these are going for $50 now if you know where to look). The price isn’t nearly as important to me as the files that are held on the card. Since I don’t have one single computer I can call my own (I bounce around between my PC here at work, my fiancée’s computer, and my mom’s computer), I keep all of my personal files on my SD card.

I left my wallet in a shopping cart at a local grocery store. I realized less than an hour later and called the store to see if someone had turned it in. No such luck. I called again two or three more times, all the while watching my bank statements like a hawk looking for any bogus charges. After 48 hours, I gave up on finding it, cancelled my cards, and went down to the local DMV to get a new license. I figured if someone decent had found it, they would’ve turned it in by then or at least contacted me.

Fortunately, last Saturday my wayward wallet found it’s way to my parents’ mailbox. Everything is intact. All my credit cards, my ID, my Palm, my SD card — everything (I very rarely use cash, so there was none in the wallet when I lost it). Ironically, my new credit cards arrived in the mailbox that same day.

Whoever you are, I’m sure you’ll probably never read this, but thanks for doing such a decent thing. I’m sorry I didn’t have much faith in you — I thought for sure you were selling my Palm on eBay by now. Your simple act of kindness means more than I can attach any dollar amount to.
