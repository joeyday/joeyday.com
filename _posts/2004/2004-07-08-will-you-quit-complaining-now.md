Well, I still haven’t done any graphic work, but I think the layout is pretty much in place. It will probably be tweaked pixel-wise to fit whatever design I build, but you get the basic idea. I would love to have something like the design over at “Ordered List”:http://www.orderedlist.com, but it probably won’t happen. Graphic Design is not my forté.

Enough of you have been complaining about the splash screen (was it really that hard to click the preview link?) that I’ve finally taken it down. I don’t feel quite so embarrassed about the site anymore; it actually looks alright like this. Rest assured, though — it won’t look this way for long.
