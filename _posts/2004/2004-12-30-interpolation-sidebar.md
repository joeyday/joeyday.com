Using instructions provided by Jon Hicks over at “Hicksdesign.co.uk”:http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/626, I’ve added a new item to my sidebar (it’s getting kinda long, isn’t it?). It’s a dynamic list of links pulled from my \[del.icio.us\] bookmarks. From time to time I’ll post links I feel are interesting, but not interesting enough to deserve a full post.
