I’m seriously considering a switch to “WordPress”:http://www.wordpress.org, but I’m not sure I’m ready to take the plunge, yet. I’ve installed a test at joeyday.com/wp so I can try it out. It’s very different from MT.

What I like about it is that pages are generated entirely with PHP and MySQL. No Perl/CGI is used at all, meaning pages are truly dynamic. In addition, WP is open source (MT recently went commercial, offering a hard-to-find free version with limited allowable use).

I’ll keep you posted on my decision to switch.

\_\[EDIT: The test site listed above was originally linked, but I’ve made the switch now so I removed the link.\]\_
