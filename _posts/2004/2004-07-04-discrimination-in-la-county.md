Have you heard about the ACLU’s recent gripe against Los Angelos County? Apparently, they have alleged that the symbol of a cross on the L.A. County seal violates the Constitutional principle of separation of church and state. I’ve provided a picture of the seal so that you can see what I’m talking about. The cross is VERY small.

I, for one, am glad the ACLU is worried about separation of church and state. I believe in that principle, and I might have been in agreement with their recent argument, except for one glaringly obvious problem. Notice the lady in the middle of the seal? That’s the pagan goddess Pomona!

Since it is much bigger than the seemingly insignificant little cross, that image of Pomona (goddess of gardens and fruit trees) probably should’ve been the first target in the effort to uphold the Constitution. Unfortunately, by attacking the cross first, they ACLU has merely proven (as if it wasn’t clear already) that they are not so much against integration of church and state as they are simply against Christianity.

The ACLU has issued statements against many other counties whose seals bear crosses, but will they send statements to any counties whose seals contain only pagan or other religious symbols? Sadly, I doubt it.
