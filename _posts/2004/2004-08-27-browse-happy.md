A new site, “Browse Happy”:http://www.browsehappy.com, has been created by the “Web Standards Project”:vhttp://webstandards.org/act/campaign/happy/. It’s aim is to reach the world with the message that there are alternative browsers. They have (or at least, will soon have) testimonials from users of “Mozilla”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x, “Mozilla Firefox”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox, “Opera”:http://www.opera.com, and “Safari”:http://www.apple.com/safari.

They also feature information about why IE is unsafe, along with promotional buttons so that browser evangelists can point traffic to their site. Their style seems a little girly, but all-in-all it’s a fun (and practical) site.
