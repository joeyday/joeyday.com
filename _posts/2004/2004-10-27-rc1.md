\[Firefox\] is a step closer to coming out of beta. Version 1.0 RC1 was released this morning, but it’s not a regular update. If you’d like to test it out, see the “software update “:http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/qa/softwareupdate.html page.

I’ll probably wait to install it tomorrow morning. I should have a little time then to write a review if I find any new features/bug fixes worth mentioning.
