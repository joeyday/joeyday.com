Avocation has finally been ported fully from \[Movable Type\] to \[WordPress\]. There are still a few things I’ll need to figure out before I can port my \[Foundation\] blog, but I’m pleased with the way WordPress is handling my content. I especially love not having to rebuild anything. I also feel better knowing I’ll never have to pay to use my blog software.

If you see anything that still looks funny, let me know.
