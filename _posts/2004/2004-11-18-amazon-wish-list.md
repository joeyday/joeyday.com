My brother-in-law just sent me an email requesting that I set up an “Amazon Wish List”:http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/104-1222795-7263163?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;id=37LQWPA3ML80C. I’ve had one set up for a little while, but it was in serious need of some pruning. I spent a little time today polishing it up, so if you’d like to get me something for Christmas, be sure to check there for ideas. I’ll probably be adding more stuff as the holiday approaches.

If you have a wish list, let me know in a comment.
