I recently discovered through “The Inquirer”:http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=17382 that the IE development team has started a new “IE Blog”:http://blogs.msdn.com/ie.

Is this some kind of horrible joke? Do these guys actually believe that “IE is the best browser in the world”:http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/07/21/190747.aspx? I’m having trouble deciding which is more funny: the serious (but totally off-base) posts by the developers themselves, or the comments left by readers. The comments section is basically one big ad for Firefox!
