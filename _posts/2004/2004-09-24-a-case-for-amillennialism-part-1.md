This book changed my perspective of eschatology dramatically.

The word eschatology comes from the greek word ἔσχατος (eschatos, “the last”), and means the study of last things. It can be used in a personal sense when talking about final states such as heaven and hell, but is also used in a general sense when speaking of the events associated with Christ’s second coming and the culmination of the world as we know it.

When I became an Evangelical Christian and began a serious study of theology, my understanding of the last days didn’t change much. The LDS concept of the end is very similar to the dispensational movement that has been sweeping through Christianity for the last several decades, most notably in the <cite>Left Behind</cite> series of fiction novels.

With the exception of the rapture, Mormons agree with nearly every eschatalogical truth-claim dispensationalists make. For instance, LDS prophets have repeatedly taught that the Lord has dispensed truth to the world at different times and in sundry ways throughout the course of history. They believe that we are currently in the last dispensation, which began when revelation was given to the prophet Joseph Smith (dispensationalists are waiting for the last dispensation, which they believe will begin when Christ returns). When Christ comes, Satan will be bound, the first resurrection will take place, and “Christ will reign personally upon the earth” ((Joseph Smith, Articles of Faith 1:10.)) for a thousand years—the Millennium. At the end of the thousand years, Satan will be loosed for a short time and a great battle will take place. At the end of the battle will come the second/last resurrection and the final judgement. This is consistent with a straightforward reading of Rev. 19:11-21 and Rev 20:1-15. Because they believe that the second coming will happen before the Millennium, Mormons fall loosely under a category of belief known as dispensational premillennialism.

My own study of theology upon leaving Mormonism has been greatly influenced by a theology professor named Millard Erickson. I’ve never met the man, but a trusted pastor recommended his books to me and I own several of them, including his 1,400-page systematic theology textbook simply titled, [<cite>Christian Theology</cite>](http://amzn.com/0801021820/?tag=joeyday-20). In his writings, Erickson cautiously aligns himself with historic premillennialism—that is, he does not agree with the tenets of dispensationalism, but does agree that there will be an earthly millennial reign of Jesus Christ after the second coming.

Upon reading Erickson’s arguments for historic premillennialism and against other eschatalogical positions, I became convinced that his position was the most biblical. Recently, I began a new job at a local Christian bookstore, and was first introduced to a position known as amillennialism by the owner of the store. I was skeptical at first, but he showed me a few scriptures that got me thinking. I decided to really study this out to an extent that I never have before, and consequently started reading the book that is the subject of this review.

Amillennialism asserts that the thousand year period mentioned in Rev. 20:1-6 is simply the stretch of time between the first and second advents of Christ, and, therefore, the Millennial reign of Christ and binding of Satan are present realities. The second coming, the resurrection, and the final judgment will all take place on the last day of time as we know it, and will usher in the eternities.

Riddlebarger makes quite an extensive argument for the amillennial position, sufficiently overcoming nearly all the difficulties and presenting a few of his own difficulties for proponents of the opposing views. He is thoroughly biblical and careful to examine the whole of scripture before making any conclusions about single obscure passages. I personally found his argument to be slightly disorganized and repetitive, but it was nonetheless convincing.

In part two I’ll explain some of the scriptural arguments for both premillennialism and amillennialism. Stay tuned.
