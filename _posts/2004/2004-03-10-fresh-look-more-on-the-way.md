I changed my style sheet a bit and revamped the logo today. These both took me all of half an hour, but they freshen up the site a bit. Itâ€™s just weird seeing my own writings in black rather than my trademark green, but Iâ€™ll get used to it.

I also installed some plugins (namely [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) and [MT-Textile](http://bradchoate.com/mt-plugins/textile)) that change the way curly quotes and other fancy typography is generated, so donâ€™t be surprised if you find screwy typography or layout in some of the older posts. It will probably be some time before I can get to that â€” in fact it may never happen at all.

I have grand schemes to redo the entire site, but itâ€™ll be a while before I have the time to do it. I want to roll back to a simpler layout. The bloated menus are beginning to bug me. ðŸ˜€
