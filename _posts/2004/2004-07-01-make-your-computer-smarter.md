I uninstalled Internet Explorer from my work computer this morning, and let me tell you, I feel a lot better. My computer somehow seems smarter.

The only reason I was keeping IE around was so I could listen to my favorite streaming radio station, “K-LOVE Christian Music”:http://www.klove.com. Fortunately for me, they addressed some problems with Windows Media Player in Firefox 0.9, so now I can actually connect to the station in Firefox.

Uninstalling IE is easier than you might think. In Windows XP, you simply go to the “Add or Remove Programs” option in the Control Panel and choose “Add/Remove Windows Components” from the buttons on the left. IE appears on the list with a little check box next to it. Simply remove the checkmark and continue through the setup wizard. In no time your computer will be free from inferior browsers.

Happy Firefoxing.
