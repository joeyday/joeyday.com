I’ve almost matched my former \[Movable Type\] blog using \[WordPress\].

Here’s a list of things that still need to be done (I’ll cross them off as I go, and may add more as they come up):

\# <del>Validate XHTML 1.0 Strict.</del>  
\# <del>Fix front page (3 entries with excerpts, 5 with titles only).</del>  
\# <del>Enable unique page titles (currently all pages say “Home”).</del>  
\# <del>Fix imported entries:</del>  
\*\* <del>Add newlines before and after “more” links.</del>  
\*\* <del>Set all to “Allow Pings.”</del>  
\# <del>‘Figure out middot before “Comments” link’:http://wordpress.org/support/3/13941 (shows up by itself on individual entry pages).</del>  
\# <del>Fix “Information” page (create two separate headstart.inc files, or fork it using a variable?).</del>  
\# <del>Bring back familiar emoticons.</del>  
\# <del>Interblog menu.</del>  
\# <del>“Commentation” sidebar — recent comments (do I really want to keep this?).</del>  
\# <del>Numbered comments.</del>  
\# <del>Comment preview.</del>

For my \[Foundation\] blog, the following things will need to be figured out before a switch is possible:

\# Scripture linker.  
\# “Edification” sidebar. Find a plugin like MT-BookQueue? One possibility: WP-Amazon. Will I need a separate blog?

Here are a few other things I’d like to add when I find the time:

\# <del>Figure out WordPress links manager — add “Interpolation” and “Correlation” sidebars.</del> (done with \[del.icio.us\].)  
\# Figure out how to display a closing quotation mark in blockquotes. Use :first-child pseudo-class?  
\# Figure out Next and Previous links on archive pages.

I’m grateful for all the help I’ve received so far in switching to WordPress, and would ask that if anyone knows a quick way to cross off one or more of the above items, do let me know. Thanks.
