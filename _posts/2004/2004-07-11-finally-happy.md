I think I’m finally satisfied with the way things look around here. The stock background image in the header is temporary, at least until I can get outside and take some photos. I think I’d like to take a panoramic shot of Salt Lake from Grandeur Peak, the tallest mountain on the east side of the Salt Lake Valley.

There’s still work to be done to make the layout look better in IE. IE doesn’t support the PNG graphics used to create the translucent navigation bar, so instead you’ll get an ugly white thing with unreadable text. I’m researching hacks that might work to trick IE into rendering something a little more readable, but in the meantime, why not download a “superior browser”:http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox?

Comments, questions, glaring inconsistencies? Post ’em here. Thanks.
