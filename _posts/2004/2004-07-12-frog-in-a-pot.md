Microsoft is going down, and they just don’t get it. I just read a “PCWorld.com”:http://www.pcworld.com article about “browser market share”:http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,116848,00.asp. Apparently, IE has lost 1% of the market, which isn’t much, but it’s the most significant downturn for them since June 2002. The downturn has been attributed to the “US-CERT recommendation”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6746-2004Jun25.html that people stop using IE.

Here’s an excerpt I found particularly asinine:

bq. Microsoft shares its users’ concerns over security and encourages users to “examine all options,” a company spokesman said in an e-mail statement. The company believes that factors such as functionality and manageability, “as well as security backed by the processes and engineering discipline employed by Microsoft,” will convince users that IE is the best choice, he said.

Best choice, my foot! The functionality and manageability of IE pale in comparison to every other browser on the market, and don’t even get me started on security. I’m not sure what “banana truck”:http://images.google.com/images?q=banana+truck Bill Gates fell off of, but if he doesn’t wake up and smell the browser war, he’s toast.
