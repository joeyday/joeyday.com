I received a fun little package in the mail last week: the “Strong Bad Sings CD”:http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Strong\_Bad\_Sings\_CD.

Some of the songs are lame, but for the most part it’s a great CD. I especially like “The Cheat is Not Dead,” “Techno,” and all the songs by Limozeen and Taranchula.
