According to “Wired”:http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/view.html?pg=3, Stephen Toulouse, security program manager for Microsoft, uses Firefox.

Toulouse was interviewed about recent security flaws in IE. He mentioned Firefox in passing, and I think he only brought it up in a lame attempt to show that all browsers are subject to the same security issues as IE — all he said about Firefox is that he had to download a security update recently.

It sounds to me as though he only uses it for testing, but it’s at least comforting to know that Microsoft is sitting up and taking notice of their latest competitors.

Thanks to “Tom”:http://www.tompreuss.com/index.php?p=69 for the heads up.
