I’m not sure how I missed [this one](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=4436) on [MozillaZine](http://www.mozillazine.org) last week. Apparently, the U.S. Patent Office has decided that [Eolas’ patent on browser plugin technology](http://joeyday.com/archives/individual/000475.php) is invalid. This is a victory for the W3C and open web standards, but it’s almost unfortunate, since IE is the [only browser that would have been affected](http://joeyday.com/archives/individual/000493.php). No plugin support in IE probably would’ve caused more people to move to standards-compliant browsers like \[Mozilla Firefox\].
