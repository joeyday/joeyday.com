I’ve been working on it behind a closed curtain for some time now, but “Joey Day : Foundation”:http://www.joeyday.org is finally ready for human consumption.

This new blog will be about my theology and faith, and I would encourage you to read and/or bookmark it if you are curious about what I believe. I’ve separated the content of my sites for the benefit of those who have an interest in technology and web-design, but little to no interest in Evangelical Christian theology (and vice versa).
