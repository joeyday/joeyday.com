<div class="pic">[![Firefox Setup 1.0PR.exe](/images/firefoxsetup-pr.png "Firefox Setup 1.0PR.exe")](http://www.getfirefox.com)</div>==

Every day moves us closer to a full release of Firefox. The “1.0 Preview Release”:http://www.getfirefox.com went live this morning. I’ve downloaded and installed it, and I have to say it was the smoothest Firefox upgrade I’ve ever been through.

The only quibble I have is that a few of my favorite extensions aren’t compatible yet, but the installer didn’t miss a beat. It found all the incompatible extensions and asked me if I’d like to search for upgrades. It only found a few, but the process sure was slick.

This release also has some nice RSS/bookmark features, a master password system, improved FindFast, and — remarkably — it’s even \_smaller\_ than the last version, weighing in at only 4.5 MB.

On a related note, the “Mozilla Foundation”:http://www.mozilla.org announced a new website this week, “Spread Firefox”:http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=user/register&amp;r=5005. It was slashdotted a few times today, so if it displays a static “Welcome Slashdotters” page, wait a few minutes and try reloading. It’s got a number of new buttons and advertising graphics and a myriad of new resources for the Firefox evangelism community to help spread the word.
