I just had an “Arby’s”:http://www.arbys.com/arb01.html Beef ‘n’ Cheddar with homestyle fries. Holy cow. Could anything be better? I’m having trouble thinking of anything off the top of my head. Arby’s beats Burger King and McDonald’s hands down. Their fries are the best, and roast beef is so much more refined than hamburger. Did I mention they have awesome shakes?

Man, I gotta get me some more o’ that.
