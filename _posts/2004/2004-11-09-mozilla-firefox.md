[![Mozilla Firefox 1.0 out of the box](/images/firefox-oneoh.png "Mozilla Firefox 1.0 out of the box")](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=5005&t=1)

After much anticipation, \[Mozilla Firefox\] was released today — no longer a “technology preview,” but a full-blown, stable release version. More amazing than that, for the first time I was able to run a flawless update using the new updater!

I couldn’t be more excited about this release. It’s great to be able to whole-heartedly recommend Firefox to friends without having to explain what a technology preview is and answer the inevitable question, “If it’s just a preview, does that mean it’s not stable?”. I’m confident this new release will kick the browser war up to a new level.

Have you rediscovered the web, yet? You have no more excuse. Do it today!
