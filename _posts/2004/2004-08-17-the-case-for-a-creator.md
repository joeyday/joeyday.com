[![The Case for a Creator: A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0310241448.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0310241448%2526location=/o/ASIN/0310241448%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")

I recently finished reading <cite>[The Case for a Creator](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0310241448%2526location=/o/ASIN/0310241448%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")</cite> by Lee Strobel. I’ve read through about half of <cite>[The Case for Christ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=joeyday-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0310209307%2526location=/o/ASIN/0310209307%25253FSubscriptionId=09XQMBPM9EDAPGEVZ3R2 "View product details at Amazon")</cite>, so I already knew this book would be a fun read.

Strobel’s style simply has a way of sucking the reader right into the story. In all three of his “Case” books, he’s traversed the globe interviewing experts in several different fields of study. Rather than simply regurgitating the interviews, he vividly describes the settings and relates his own thoughts as he’s travelling from interview to interview. You really get the feeling that you are there on a quest for truth right alongside him.

All in all, this was a great book. There’s a plethora of current scientific research that points to God, and Strobel lets the evidence speak for itself as often as possible. He doesn’t refer to the Bible very often in this book, mostly because he is really only concerned with the scientific evidence. Those who believe science can’t account for God will either hate this book or find it extremely intriguing.

I’m a full-on creationist myself, believing the world was literally created in seven days around 7,000 years ago. One thing that irked me about this book is that the scientists interviewed often talk about events that supposedly happened tens of thousands of years ago. I’m willing to accept the fact that current science doesn’t seem to support a literal interpretation of the creation as it is told in the Bible, and I can’t in all honesty condemn Strobel for not saying more about this in his book. His aim is not to explain exactly how the creation happened, but whether or not there was a creation at all.

After interviewing eight scientists (one of them twice) in several fields ranging from astronomy to physics to molecular biology, Strobel concludes that the majority of recent developments in science point emphatically to a creator, but he goes one step further.

Many scientists embrace “Deism”:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism, a belief that an intelligent creator designed the universe, but built it so that it is self-regulating, and requires no additional intervention to continue running in order. They posit that God started the ball rolling, but has kept His nose out since then. Strobel refutes this idea by showing through reason and science that God cannot be the impersonal God of Deism. On the contrary, He is personal, creative, caring, and continues to work in our universe.

One of the things I most loved about this book is the number of different angles Strobel approaches each interview from. He was an atheist for many years before becoming a Christian, and evolution and random chance seemed to him to be the best explanation for the world around us. He seems to understand well many of the arguments atheists utilize against creationism (though I’m not an athiest, so I can’t tell you if he really asked the tough questions). The scientists interviewed field all of his “devil’s advocate” questions without blinking. They have a ready answer for every one of his arguments.

This book has served to strengthen my faith in creationism and in our Creator. I’m not sure if it would convince an atheist, but I would recommend it as food for thought to anyone who is seeking. The book doesn’t get preachy, but encourages the reader to really study the sum of the evidence and come to their own conclusion. Strobel is confident — and so am I — that anyone who is willing to examine \_all\_ of the evidence will reasonably conclude that God is real, that He is personal, and that He cares for us and longs for us to discover Him.
