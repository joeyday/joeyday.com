I’ve realized that my philosophy has been a little skewed of late. I’ve been sacrificing content to style, and it should be the other way around.

Therefore, exactly three months after tearing my site down to do this redesign (boy am I lazy), I’m going to start posting new entries — even though my site looks like crap in a brown paper sack. Perhaps having the new entries will motivate me to make this place look less hideous?
