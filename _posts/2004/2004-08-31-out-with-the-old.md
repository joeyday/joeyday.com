I just archived a bunch of old entries off to a different area of the site. I got tired of looking at such a long list of categories, half of which I wasn’t using. I’ve kept pretty much everything since June of last year, which is when my focus shifted to mostly web-related content.

The old stuff is at “Joey Day : First Edition”:http://firstedition.joeyday.com. I may clean that up a little, but for now the default MT template should do just fine.
