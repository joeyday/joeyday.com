I’m writing this entry in Internet Explorer 7. Let me back up—I’m not sure you heard me correctly. I’m not writing this in Internet Explorer 7 Beta or even in the Internet Explorer 7 Release Candidate. I’m writing this post using the official release of Internet Explorer 7. The [official release announcement](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx) was made this afternoon on [IEBlog](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/).

You can [download Internet Explorer 7 now](http://www.microsoft.com/ie) if you’d like, or if you’re not anxious you can wait a few weeks, as the new browser will be [released as a high-priority automatic Windows update](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/updatemanagement/windowsupdate/ie7announcement.mspx).

I for one am impressed with the new product and can whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone. As far as web standards support is concerned, I don’t think IE7 hits the nail quite on the head, but it’s a far cry closer than IE6 ever was. I have to give credit where credit is due, and the Internet Explorer team has earned my praise for taking huge strides in the right direction.
