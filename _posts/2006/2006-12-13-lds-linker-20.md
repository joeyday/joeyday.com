**LDS Linker** is a WordPress plugin I created that changes any Latter-day Saint scripture reference into a hyperlink pointing to the Internet Edition of the LDS Scriptures. It recognizes references whether the book name is written out or shortened using the [standard abbreviations](http://scriptures.lds.org/helps/abbrvtns).

Here are some examples:

> Moro. 10:3-5 is a scripture mastery verse. Other scripture mastery verses include Mosiah 4:30, D&amp;C 130:22-23, and JS-H 1:15-20. I have Articles of Faith 1:1-13 memorized—how ’bout you?

Version 2.0 is a nearly complete rewrite of the plugin. The generated links now point directly to the referenced passage rather than performing a passage search. I also found and squashed a bunch of bugs.

You can download the plugin here:

A big thanks goes out to those who’ve helped me improve the code. Are *you* using **LDS Linker**? Please [let me know](/contact) what you think. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
