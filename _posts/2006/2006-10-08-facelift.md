The new design looks downright crappy in Internet Explorer 7 and even worse in Internet Explorer 6, but I’m working on that. Actually, I may not attempt to make it compatible with IE6 at all, preferring visitors upgrade to IE7. I can get away with that because I’m not trying to please anybody or make any money here.

I’ve got my \[del.icio.us\] bookmarks populating as regular entries and I’m working on getting my \[Flickr\] photosets to do the same. Toward that end, the [Flickr Photo Album for WordPress](http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/) plugin looks promising. I’m still working on a way to bring all my \[Foundation\] content over here. That’s going to be more complicated than I hoped. I may simply have to hold out for WordPress 2.1, which is supposed to have a fancy new export/import feature.

Anyway, all this to say that a lot of stuff is broken right now. Hold on to your shorts.

<ins datetime="2006-10-10T12:51:23+00:00">**Update:** I’ve managed to get the site looking good in Internet Explorer 7 with only minor tweaks to the code. Amazingly, it didn’t require any [IE conditional comments](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp) (or any other hacks for that matter). The exact same code is working in Firefox, Opera, and IE7, and all three browsers actually render the page as intended. This has got to be one for the record books.</ins>
