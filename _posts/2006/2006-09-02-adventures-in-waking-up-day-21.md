I stopped blogging about it, so you probably all thought I gave up on it, right? Well, I didn’t. I’m still going strong getting up at 5:00 am every morning. I’ve had a few rough mornings where the alarm clock failed to go off and a few mornings where I took a little “nap” after getting out of the shower, but I’ve been on time to work every day for the last three weeks and I’m pretty proud of that.

I love having time in the mornings to get things done. I’ve been so much better about spending time alone with God and reading my scriptures. I’ve also had time to catch up on my finances and budgeting, and to work on a few other projects that have been ignored far too long.

I mentioned in my first post in this early riser series that I am hoping to combine my two blogs back into one blog. I haven’t found a way to export and import my blog entries into one big blog yet, but I’ve heard that WordPress 2.1 will have that capability built-in, so I think I’m going to wait until the new version comes out.

However, I think I’ve come up with a good name for my combined blog. I’m going to call it “Σύζυγος”. If that looks like Greek to you, that’s because it is. It’s pronounced “Sood´-zoo-gos”, and it’s the word we get our English word *syzygy* from. It’s a verb that means to yoke together or to bind together. I think it’s appropriate because I’ll be “yoking” my two blogs together, but not only that, it represents the coming together of my various different hobbies and interests (including my interest in [Koine Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koine_Greek)). I also mentioned that I’d like to use the tumblelog format, so the name also appropriately denotes the coming together of many different types of media, including blog entries, \[Flickr\] photos, \[LibraryThing\] books, \[del.icio.us\] bookmarks, and whatever else I feel like throwing into the mix. Let me know what you think of the name. If too many people think it’s silly, I’m open to other suggestions.

So anyway, I think I’ve talked about this early riser thing for too many posts in a row. I’ll have some real content in my next post, I promise.
