This week’s edition of the [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com) Tech Times newsletter answers a [question I’ve had for a long time](/2004/07/14/what-the). According to the article, <cite>[PNG Colors in Internet Explorer](http://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/viewissue.php?id=3&issue=153&format=html#7)</cite>, IE is one of the only browsers that renders embedded gamma correction for PNG images, which is what causes them to appear slightly discolored. Most other browsers ignore any embedded gamma correction. The article even gives a nice solution for stripping the gamma correction values out of your PNG images. Score!
