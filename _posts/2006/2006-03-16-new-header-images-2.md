I’ve replaced the header images both on this blog and on my \[Avocation\] blog. I had to finagle a half-transparent box just to make the text readable on both sites, but I don’t think it looks half bad (note that I haven’t looked at it in IE yet). One down side is it breaks when you increase or decrease your text size. I’d love to rip this all down and start over, but I don’t have the time, and I think this small change will keep me satisfied with this layout for a few months more.

The image here is the inner workings of a Burlington Bulldog railroad watch. I went looking for photos of pocket watches ((Why a pocket watch? For the connection, see the [Teleological argument for the existence of God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument).)) and found this one in [Kevin Trotman’s](http://www.flickr.com/people/kt/) Flickr photo stream. It’s licensed under a Creative Commons license and I’ve given Kevin proper attribution in my blog footer, so I am using it with permission. You can find the original photo [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kt/1132717/). The image on my Avocation blog is a picture I took yesterday from my office window on the eighth floor. It is the wasatch mountains on the East side of the Salt Lake Valley (specifically, Mount Olympus just left of center and Twin Peaks off to the right).
