I woke up at 5:00 am this morning to take my mother-in-law to the airport. I think I’ll stick with 5:00 am from here on out. I’m feeling good and today was the first day that my waking up was almost automatic. I can feel this slowly transitioning from willpower to habit.

I feel bad because haven’t commuted by bicycle all week, but Janene and I did go on a nice two mile ride last night. It was her first time on a bike in a while and I’m still getting back in shape, so it was good for both of us. I’m starting to eat healthier and I’ve even started taking a multi-vitamin. I’m beginning to feel really healthy, but Janene keeps asking me what I’ve done with her husband. :p

My dad told me today that my Grandpa Day was something of a health nut. Apparently, when he was a teenager the President of the United States unveiled a national health initiative ((I haven’t been able to find which president this was (possibly T. Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, or Harding) or exactly when this took place (my Grandpa was young in the 1910’s and 1920’s). I’d love to see exactly what my Grandpa learned from the initiative and how it helped him develop his good habits. If anybody knows anything about our nation’s history of health initiatives, drop me a line using my [Contact](/contact) page. Thanks.)), and Grandpa learned many health-conscious habits in early life, including getting up early in the morning. My dad says Grandpa always got up at 4:00 am! Of course, he was a dairy farmer, so I suspect he got up that early mostly to milk the cows, but my dad says he had learned to wake up early even in his younger years.

So, I guess I’m following in Grandpa’s footsteps. I hope I’m gaining habits that will stay with me the rest of my life.
