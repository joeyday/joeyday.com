In case you haven’t heard, [Pat Robertson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Robertson) recently made some [rather idiotic comments](http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-05-robertson_x.htm) on [Ariel Sharon’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon) recent medical crisis. In a nutshell, Robertson is claiming Sharon’s health problems are God’s punishment for “dividing the land of Israel.”

In answer to Robertson, there’s a well-written and insightful [open letter](http://www.knoxseminary.org/Prospective/Faculty/WittenbergDoor/index.html) popping up on several of the Evangelical blogs I read. The letter wasn’t written in direct response to Robertson’s recent statement — in fact, it was written in 2002 — but it’s contents are surprisingly relevant. I’ve read it a few times and agree with it whole-heartedly.

It should go without saying that Robertson doesn’t speak for all Christians when he makes these kind of comments, but this letter really explains what the position of Christians should be with regard to events in Israel. It also states clearly why Robertson and those who agree with him are wrong in their thinking and stand in oposition to the clear statements of the Bible with regard to this issue.
