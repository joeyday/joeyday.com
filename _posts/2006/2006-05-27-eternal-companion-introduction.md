I’ve [mentioned before](/2005/12/15/hebrews-series) that I’m teaching a series of small group Bible studies on the subject of Hebrews. One of the study guides I’ve been using has an interesting title for chapter 7: “Eternal Companion”. If you know very much about Mormonism you probably know this phrase has special significance to Latter-day Saints. They hold a doctrine known as the new and everlasting covenant of marriage, which states that a person can be sealed to their spouse for “time and all eternity.” In such a marriage, it’s customary for a husband or wife to refer to his or her spouse using the term “eternal companion.”

I find this chapter title fascinating, because I think it illustrates a primary difference between Mormonism and Protestant Christianity. The chapter, which predictably covers chapter 7 of Hebrews, is about how Christ is our eternal companion. The chapter never comes close to mentioning Mormonism or even marriage, but, without meaning to, it teaches an idea that I think runs directly contrary to Mormon doctrine.

I have a tendency to start writing really long posts and never finish them. I’ve actually been working on this post for a while and have decided to break it down into smaller pieces so I can finally get it published. Stay tuned for a few more posts on this subject.

In the meantime, here are some references regarding celestial marriage for those who may not be familiar with it:
