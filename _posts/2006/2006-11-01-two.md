I know I’m a little behind the times here. I was aware of this about five minutes after it happened, but I haven’t had time to blog about it until tonight. [Firefox 2](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=5005&t=85) was officially released over a week ago.

To be honest, I’m a bit disappointed with this release. Sure, it has a slick new look and some new bells and whistles (e.g., in-line spell check, session restore, and anti-phishing), but it’s lacking in one area that makes all the difference for me: XML feed support. To be fair, it’s got better support for feeds than Firefox 1.5, but this is one area where I’m sad to say Internet Explorer 7 is winning.

[Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com) already voiced a few of my [complaints about Firefox 2’s feed support](http://lifehacker.com/software/firefox/ie7-still-handles-feeds-better-than-firefox-20-204051.php) (or lack thereof), but one thing they failed to mention is that Firefox 2 has poor support for third-party feed readers. I use Mozilla Thunderbird to manage my feeds, and, paradoxically, [Firefox can’t add feed subscriptions to Thunderbird](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=348450). This bug really should’ve been a version 2 release blocker, but somehow it sailed right through without being noticed. Hopefully they’ll fix this bug in a 2.0.1 release or something soon.

Other than that (and a minor unsettledness about the new look), I do love the browser and recommend that everyone download it as soon as possible. Happy browsing!
