*Notice: [A newer version of LDS Linker has been released](http://joeyday.com/to/lds-linker).*

**LDS Linker** is a WordPress plugin I created that changes any Latter-day Saint scripture reference into a hyperlink pointing to the Internet Edition of the LDS Scriptures. It recognizes references whether the book name is written out or shortened using the [standard abbreviations](http://scriptures.lds.org/helps/abbrvtns).

Here are some examples:

> Moro. 10:3-5 is a scripture mastery verse. Other scripture mastery verses include Mosiah 4:30, D&amp;C 130:22-23, and JS-H 1:15-20. I have Articles of Faith 1:1-13 memorized—how ’bout you?

Version 1.2.1 stopped working a few months ago when the LDS church made significant changes to the way search queries are performed against their scripture system. Version 1.3 attempts to address that issue but probably doesn’t go far enough. <del datetime="2006-12-08T02:46:46+00:00">I’m aware that D&amp;C references are broken in this version (because the &amp; symbol isn’t being encoded properly before being passed to scriptures.lds.org).</del> I’m sure there are <del datetime="2006-12-08T02:46:46+00:00">other</del> issues I’m not aware of, so please let me know if you find anything fishy. I plan to rework the whole system soon so it links directly to passages instead of to search queries (i.e. [Moro. 10:3-5](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/10/3-5#3) instead of [Moro. 10:3-5](http://scriptures.lds.org/search?search=moro%2010%3A3-5)).

<ins datetime="2006-12-08T02:46:46+00:00">Version 1.4 comes hot on the heels of 1.3 and fixes the Doctrine and Covenants links issue. I found that using the `urlencode()` function around the book name tamed that pesky ampersand into submission and thus restored the Doctrine and Covenants to the list of books **LDS Linker** can handle.</ins>

A big thanks to those who’ve helped me improve the code. Are *you* using **LDS Linker**? Please [let me know](/contact) what you think. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
