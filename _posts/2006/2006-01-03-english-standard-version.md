We spent a few days at the [Anniversary Inn](http://www.anniversaryinn.com) in Logan, Utah. It‚Äôs a very romantic place and we‚Äôd recommend it to any couple.

As an anniversary gift, Janene bought me a new Bible. I have a couple of study Bibles, but this time around I was looking for something lightweight with less distractions. Those study Bibles get pretty bulky and I‚Äôm starting to think study notes (and even cross-references) distract too much from the actual text of scripture. I‚Äôm excited about studying the Bible by itself and not relying on those ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù.

I also wanted a new translation. As I‚Äôve mentioned here before, I really appreciate the diversity that currently exists in Bible translations. I try not to get attached to any one translation for too long, and lately I‚Äôve been really intrigued by the English Standard Version.

<div class="lpic-transparent">[![ESV Bible](/images/esv.png)](http://www.esv.org)</div>The ESV is not a complete re-translation of the Bible like the NIV. Instead, the ESV translators used the RSV (1971) as a starting point. The RSV text in turn owes its existence to the ASV (1901; from which the NASB also comes), the RV (1885), and ultimately the KJV (1611). Since the ESV is a direct descendant of the KJV, it retains, according to its preface, ‚Äúthe same depth of meaning and enduring language that have made their indelible mark on the English-speaking world and have defined the life and doctrine of the church over the last four centuries.‚Äù To see how similar the ESV is to the KJV, compare [both translations of Romans 8 side-by-side](http://studylight.org/par/view.cgi?query=romans+8&section=0&l1=en&t1=kjv&l2=en&t2=esv&Enter=Search).

As similar to the KJV as it is, the ESV is also as up-to-date as possible, yielding one of the most accurate translations available today. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúessentially literal‚Äù translation and I like it for many of the same reasons I like the NASB. That said, I think it pulls ahead of the NASB in being slightly more readable. It just seems to flow better to me.

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt really had the time to break my new Bible in yet, so I think I‚Äôll go read it now. üôÇ
