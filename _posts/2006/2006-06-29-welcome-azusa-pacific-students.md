<div class="rpic">[![Azusa Pacific University logo](/images/azusapacific.gif)](http://www.apu.edu)</div>I presented my testimony to a group of students from [Azusa Pacific University](http://www.apu.edu) last night up at [Salt Lake Theological Seminary](http://www.slts.edu). They send one or two groups to Salt Lake every summer on mission trips, and Iâ€™ve shared with a previous group before. It was a pleasure and a blessing chatting with you guys and I just want to reiterate that if you have any questions or comments, feel free to use my [contact form](/contact) to drop me a line. Cheers!
