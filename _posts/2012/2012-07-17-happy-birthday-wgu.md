The university I work for, Western Governors University, is celebrating fifteen years this year, and it just occurred to me Iâ€™ve been around for nearly half those years (the last seven). It started out a pretty amazing idea by some pretty amazing people, turned out to be a pretty amazing university, and I consider it a pretty amazing place to work. Happy birthday, WGU!
