John Piper on C. S. Lewis on praise:

> Lewis says that as he was beginning to believe in God, a great stumbling block was the presence of demands scattered through the Psalms that he should praise God. He did not see the point in all this; besides, it seemed to picture God as craving “for our worship like a vain woman who wants compliments.” He goes on to show why he was wrong:
> 
> “But the most obvious fact about praise—whether of God or anything—strangely escaped me. I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or the giving of honor. I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise. . . . The world rings with praise—lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet, walkers praising the countryside, players praising their favorite game. . . .
> 
> “My whole, more general difficulty about the praise of God depended on my absurdly denying to us, as regards the supremely Valuable, what we delight to do, what indeed we can’t help doing, about everything else we value.
> 
> “I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.” ((C. S. Lewis (1958). *Reflections on the Psalms* (pp. 94–95). Harcourt, Brace &amp; World.)) ((Piper, John (2011). *Desiring God, Revised Edition: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist* (Kindle Locations 253–264). Random House, Inc. Kindle Edition.))
