I blogged rather cryptically several months ago about [correlation and causation](http://joeyday.com/2011/08/29/correlation/), referencing one of my favorite web comics. Today, as promised in that blog post, I’m finally able to provide more information.

I wrote a research paper a couple years ago for a language and communications course in my bachelors degree program: <cite>[Essential fatty acids and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder](http://papers.jday.us/view/efas)</cite>. This week I finally finished the second half of that language and communications course, a video presentation on the same subject, and I’m proud to be able to share it with you.

I want to say you should turn the lights down low, pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy, but the reality is this will probably bore you to tears. Maybe you insomniacs out there can use this instead of your sleeping pills tonight.

Here are the documents I mention right at the beginning of the video:
