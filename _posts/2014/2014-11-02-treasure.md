Since I began studying covenant theology in the past couple years, I’ve become partial to verses of hymns that speak of God being our highest treasure, portion, or inheritance.

My new favorite verse of <cite>Be Thou My Vision</cite> is:

> Riches I heed not nor man’s empty praise,  
> Thou mine inheritance now and always;  
> Thou and thou only first in my heart;  
> High king of heaven, my treasure thou art. ((<cite>Be Thou My Vision</cite>, Eleanor Hull, 1912.))

My new favorite verse of <cite>Amazing Grace</cite> is:

> The Lord has promised good to me,  
> His word my hope secures;  
> He will my shield and portion be,  
> As long as life endures. ((<cite>Amazing Grace</cite>, John Newton, 1779.))

These hymn verses echo for me the promise of God reiterated in every progressive revelation of the covenant of grace that he will be God to us and we will be his people (Genesis 17:7; Leviticus 26:11–12; Jeremiah 31:33; Revelation 21:3). They remind me that God is indeed “the strength of my heart and my portion forever” (Psalm 73:26).{% include endmark.html %}
