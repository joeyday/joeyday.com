I guess I’m doing a bad job of keeping up to date here. It’s probably because nothing is going on. I’ve been bored out of my mind what with Janene up at school all day doing Marching Band camp, and then both of us working in the evening. I’m stuck sitting around the house doing practically nothing, which makes me somewhat excited for school to be starting Wednesday.

Stu is finally putting together a complete website! He’s reestablished his domain with Go Daddy, so his website is now [cool-stu.com](http://www.cool-stu.com). He’s going to have a weblog/journal format similar to mine. Hopefully he’ll be able to stick with it better than I do. Anyway, it looks like he’s got a winning design going. You should check it out. Since he’s starting from the ground up, he’s decided to employ Cascading Style Sheets in his HTML authoring, and he’s actually really enjoying it. I guess I’ll have to buckle down and learn them so I don’t feel left out.
