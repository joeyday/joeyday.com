Today I want to wish my sweetheart, Janene, a happy 20th birthday! Janene, I want you to know that you are very special to me. You are the shoulder I cry on, the person I smile with, my best friend. I love you more than life. Happy Birthday!

By the way, the new Google search box at the top of the page is intended as a birthday present for Janene. She is the only person I’m aware of who actually uses ‘Qangaroo.com’ for her web browser’s startup page. She must really like me or something. ;){% include endmark.html %}
