title: Counting Chickens

I took my car into the shop today. It's been shaking a little bit for several months now, but I didn't realize anything was wrong until the check engine light came on the other day. Turns out one of my cylinders is misfiring. This could be due to a bad sparkplug, in which case all I need is a tune-up. But then it could also be a bad distributor cap, or something called an EGR valve. Anyway, I put it in today for a tune-up and an oil change. Hopefully that will fix the problem.

I finished my first assignment for my online Calculus class. It was a piece of cake, but then it was mostly review. We probably won't start the really tough stuff for a few more weeks. Of course, this next week we have two assignments due, so maybe I should not count my chickens before they hatch?{% include endmark.html %}
