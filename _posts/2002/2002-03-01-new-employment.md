Well, I’m excited! I just got a job at a local mexican restaurant called [Guadalahonky’s](http://www.guadalahonkys.com/) (There will also be a link posted on my links page as soon as I build it...). I’ll start out as a host but should get the opportunity to move up to a server position soon.{% include endmark.html %}
