title: Fixed, But Not Really

I got my computer back! Unfortunately, they didn't fix the problem at all. The replaced the power supply, and the fan isn't having any problems anymore. However, the computer still locks up after being on for about 15 minutes. Two things make me think it is not an operating system problem. One, the computer works just fine as long as I've got the case open. I can boot it up and leave it on for hours. Second, the day I got it back I was making some changes to my BIOS settings (before Windows ever booted up) and the computer locked. So, I'm going to be taking it back into the shop today. We'll see if they can properly diagnose the problem this time, eh?

I've been thinking about all this, and I know that the Lord is chastening me. He wants me to realize that my material possesions could be gone tomorrow if He willed it. They came from Him, and He can take them away. I'm really learning to depend more on Him for my needs. I am grateful to the Lord for all the things He is continually teaching me.{% include endmark.html %}
