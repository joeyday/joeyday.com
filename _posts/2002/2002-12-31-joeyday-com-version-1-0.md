Welcome to the new and improved JoeyDay.com! It's exciting to be in a new location. What a way to start the new year, eh? Don't forget to update your bookmarksâ€”Qangaroo.com will probably be gone in about a month.

Speaking of 2003, I'll be going to a party tonight with Janene and some of her friends, as well as a second party tomorrow afternoon. I hope that everyone has a safe and happy holiday this evening. Happy New Year!

Janene's Grandmother is being moved to a different medical facility so she can continue to receive the care that she needs. We still don't know how long they plan to keep her. This situation will be better for everyone involved, since Janene's mother is a nurse and works at the place Granny is being taken. That will make visiting and looking after her a lot easier.
