title: Another New Job?!?

Well, nothing is turning out quite as I expected, but it's all good news today. My dad told me this morning that ContentWatch wants to interview me! I called and made an appointment for tomorrow at 11am with a woman named Karma Parlett. She's in charge of the tech support department, I guess. If I can get a job working in the evening it would probably be answering e-mails, which would be great. They also have tech support guys that answer the phones during the day, and I'd be open to that if that's what they need. I really hope that things go well and I can get the job. This would be an incredible opportunity to get my foot in the door of the computer industry, and something I would probably stay with through the rest of my school years.

Speaking of computers, mine is still in the shop. I tried to pick it up this morning and they informed me they are waiting on some parts. When I asked them what parts, they replied that my computer needs a new motherboard! I'm really glad I have that warranty now. ðŸ˜Š

I took my car into David Early Tires yesterday to see about getting the tire repaired, and the guyâ€”who, by the way, was a complete jerk (I'm never going back there!)â€”took one look at my tire and told me it needed to be replaced because it was completely bald. I then asked him to look at the other three for me and he showed me the tread wear indicators and said that they all needed replacing. So, I went down to Costco today with my dad and had all four of them replaced. I'm really grateful that my parents are able and willing to help me out when I'm in a pinch like that. Costco has great prices on tires and they give you free balancing, rotation, and flat repair for the life of the tires. That will probably come in handy.{% include endmark.html %}
