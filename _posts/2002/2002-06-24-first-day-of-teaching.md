I taught my first day of summer marching band today, and it was fairly productive. We were able to practice a third of the way through one of our songs. The first parade is next Wednesday, so the guys really need to learn their music and memorize stuff fast! In the past week they have proven their learning capacity. If they can continue as they have commenced, I don't think they'll have any problems accomplishing the task before them.{% include endmark.html %}
