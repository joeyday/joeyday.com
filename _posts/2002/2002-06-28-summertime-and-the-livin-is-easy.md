Another week has come to a close for the West Jordan High School drumline, and they have progressed considerably. The band is doing two parade songs this summer: _Gitana_ by Victor Lopez, and the Gershwin classic, _Summertime_. The drumline can play both songs all the way through, and they hold together for the most part. There are still a few trouble spots that need cleaning, but they are learning fast. Mrs. Leyva has asked everyone in the band to have both songs memorized by Monday, so we're going to have a little memorizing party at my house tomorrow. With this extra little push I hope they'll all be well prepared for the parade Wednesday.

This week I was offered a seat on the Technology Board for the University of Utah Student Union. A good friend of mine was just appointed chairman of the committee. The job would be to update the Union webpage and to organize technology oriented activities on campus and over the Internet. My friend says he hopes to get chat services and gaming up and running on the Union website soon. I told him I didn't have a whole lot of time this summer, but that he should definately contact me in the fall. I think it will be a lot of fun, and would certainly look great on a resume or my application for addmitance into the Computer Science Major. Anyway, have a "look see" at the [Union Website](http://www.union.utah.edu/).{% include endmark.html %}
