Well, after some deliberation I've finally got my car back. I went Monday afternoon to pick up my car, and the service center had a check validating machine. They wouldn't take my check! They were very careful to say that it had nothing to do with a sufficiency or insufficiency of funds, or with my relationship with my credit union. I was declined simply because the company who manages their check validating machine doesn't have enough information about me to determine whether or not my check is valid—whatever that's supposed to mean. It really made me mad. They wouldn't let me take my car home until I paid to have the work done and I was in a hurry to get to work. Luckily Stu had his car and I was able to hitch a ride.

So I went back yesterday and paid with cash. My car works great! I had forgotten how much power the V6 gives up hills. It has a very smooth idle now as well. Last night I tried to turn the ignition a second time because I couldn't hear the engine. I'm not used to how quiet it is supposed to run!

I'm so grateful to my Heavenly Father for this answer to my prayers. For the last several weeks I've been trying to get a hold of Janene's cousin to have him look at my car. I'm almost certain, from discussions we had about my car several months ago, that if I would've taken it to him he would've tried replacing the distributor—a $500 part! If that had happened my car would still be running horribly. To be honest, I was beginning to get frustrated with praying about my car, because it didn't seem to me that it was doing me any good. In retrospect, I'm very grateful that the Lord chose to answer my prayers in a way other than the one I expected. He always knows best, and this experience has strengthened my understanding that I should trust Him even when things aren't going the way I want or expect them to.
