Wow! It’s been two months in the making, and I’ve finally implemented every page on my website. All that was left was the [Palm OS Stuff](/palm) section, and now that’s done! :D

This doesn’t mean I’ll stop updating frequently, and I’ll certainly be adding more pages when I feel the need, but I’m glad to be over this hurdle. This means I can get on with other more important parts of my life (you mean there’s something more important than this webpage?!?).{% include endmark.html %}
