I did another parade this morningâ€”the Taylorsville Dayzz Parade. I thought we were doing the South Jordan Country Fest Parade this evening, because that's what my calendar said, but I guess Mrs. Leyva changed her mind at the last minute. Section leaders called their sections, but no one called me. I was about an hour late! Anyway, our cymbal player was there this time, so I didn't have to march. I walked alongside and gave them ice and encouragement. I also helped with a few places where the tempo isn't holding together well. It was a good opportunity to just sit back and listen and identify trouble spots. Next time we get together I'll know exactly what to work on.

I'm moving into my sister's old room. It's kindof a big project, especially since I'm still sore from the parades. My parents bought a queen sized bed so that Steve and Merissa will have something to sleep on when they come to visit. So I thought as long as they were moving furniture around, I could use a little change of pace. Hopefully I'll be all moved in by the end of today.

One more thing. I added a new Guest Map to my site (There's a little link to it on the left). It allows you to pin your location on a map of the world, along with your name and a quick comment. I hope it will be interesting to get an idea of who visits my site and where they are from.{% include endmark.html %}
