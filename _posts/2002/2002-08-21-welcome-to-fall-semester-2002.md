School started today up at the University. The bulk of my schedule falls on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so I got to see most of my classes today. I have a discussion section on Tuesday and Thursday that I haven’t seen yet, but I can’t imagine that will differ much from my expectations.

I’m taking three heavily math oriented classes: Calculus II, Physics, and a Computer Science class called Discrete Structures, which will deal with Algorithm Analysis (sounds like a blast, doesn’t it?). The only class that will (hopefully) deliver some variety is Beginning Spanish, which I’m required to take to satisfy admissions requirements.

I’m very happy with all of my professors. My Calculus professor seems like a really young graduate student, but he teaches very similarly to my Math 1050 teacher (at least from what I can tell so far), and I really liked him. The Discrete Structures professor is a real hoot. He reminds me of a High School teacher I once had. He’s one of the most boring professors I’ve ever had, and he can crack a joke without smiling, so you’re never sure if he was really joking or not.

I’ve added some downloads to my [Computers](/computers) page. Check ’em out.{% include endmark.html %}
