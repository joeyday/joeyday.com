My holiday season is going well. I've got most of my shopping done already. I think I'll go shopping tonight and then again Saturday morning and that should wrap it all up (no pun intended). If you want to know what I got youâ€”too bad! You'll just have to wait until Christmas. ðŸ˜‰

Work has been kindof exciting lately. I'm now working full time hours to cover for co-workers who are sick or on vacation. Karma's got me on the phones, too. It's a nice change of pace from answering emails in the evenings. I can see how I could get tired of it very quickly, so I'll probably be glad when I can go back to part time, but for now I'm having fun. The hours mean more money, but it will all go on the paycheck I'm scheduled to receive on December 27th, so it doesn't help much for the holidays. Of course, I've never been one to turn down money!

I hope and pray everything is going well for my friends and family. Know that I'm thinking about you all this holiday season. Merry Christmas!{% include endmark.html %}
