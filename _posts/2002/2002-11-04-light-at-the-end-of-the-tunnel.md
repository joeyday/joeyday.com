My car went into the shop this morning. I've had it looked at by so many people that to be quite honest I didn't have much faith that a solution would be found. However, they've discovered that two of my fuel injectors were indeed plugged, and they are certain this was the cause of my troubles.

So I gave them the green light to replace the two injectors and completely flush the other four. In total, the work is costing me about $750, which completely breaks me, but doesn't force me into any debt. I'll pick up the car at around four o'clock today, so I'll have to let you know later if all is well.

I do want to thank my God for the abundance of blessing I receive at his hand dailyâ€”even hourly. He is an awesome God, of that I'm convinced!
