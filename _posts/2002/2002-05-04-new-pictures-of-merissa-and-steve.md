I've updated my [Family](/family) section a bit to include pictures from Merissa and Steve's wedding. We don't have anything back from the professional photographer, but you can always trust my dad to have the good ol' digital camera handy. He managed to get some really beautiful pictures. I just want to say congratulations to the two of them, and kudos to everyone involved in the planning, especially my mom. It was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever seen.{% include endmark.html %}
