Wow, Tuesdays and Thursdays are going to be interesting. I had a 7:30 class this morning. It’s a discussion section for my Physics class and the teacher has a pretty bad accent. He seems to know what he’s talking about in Physics though, so I know I’ll learn a lot from him (as long as I can understand him, that is). However, he went about 15 minutes over today and I don’t think he noticed at all. I was late to my Spanish class on account of that. So I hope he doesn’t do this at the end of every class.

After Spanish I’m done for the day on both Tuesday and Thursday, so I should have plenty of time to do homework during these two days. I hope I can keep up with my schedule working 20 hours a week and attending class 15 hours. I know the Lord will help me accomplish my goals as I go to Him in prayer. He is a faithful God and I am greatful for His guidance and support.{% include endmark.html %}
