I have a few files on the site that were getting neglected in all the clutter of my archived journal entries, so I've added a new Articles section. As time goes by I'll probably add current news articles and other things, in the same way people keep newspaper clippings of significant events in their journal. Should be interesting to see what kind of things turn up in there, eh?

I finished Fall semester last week, my last final being on Thursday. I did so much better than I thought I did on all of my finals. I know I couldn't have done that without the Lord. It seems like in all three finals it came down to one question I couldn't answer. As I would pray about it, the concept would come back to me clearly enough that I could answer the question and feel confident about what I had written. I haven't seen any of my grades yet, but (depending on how good they are) I'll post them here when I do.

So I'm kinda floating until next semester. I'm still working 20-25 hours a week at ContentWatch, but I have to continue working evenings since someone else uses my desk during the day. Of course, she doesn't work on Fridays, so I think I'll have the weekends pretty much clear. That'll be nice.

I don't know if I've said this on the site yet (it may have been down at the time), but I registered for classes next semester. I'll be taking General Psychology, World Religions, and Calculus III. I'll also be taking Symhonic Band with Janene. All my classes are concentrated in the mornings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Symphonic Band is my only Tuesday and Thursday class. That should help a great deal with homework. I'm looking forward to next semester being much better than this one was.
