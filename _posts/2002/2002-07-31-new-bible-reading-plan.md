title: New Bible Reading Plan
date: 2002-07-31

I think I'm pretty much settled in at ContentWatch (I'm writing this on my break, by the way). Since I started, I've been working full time during the daytime hours. There are two new employees that will be starting on the phones during the day, so next week I'll be moving to part time in the evening. I'm still enjoying my job very much!

I finished my second to last homework assignment for my online Calculus class last night. I have a B (88.8%) in the class right now, but I have an exam tomorrow and the final exam is next week, so my grade could change drastically here in the next few days. Everybody pray for me, okay?

I'm starting a new Bible reading plan. I want to read the whole thing in a year. I've read the New Testament a few times through, but I've never had the gusto to tackle the Old Testament. I found a cool four track reading schedule that I'm going to follow, so instead of starting out reading four chapters a day in Genesis, I'll read one chapter each day from four different starting places: Genesis, 1 Chronicles, Isaiah, and Matthew. I think that should break it up in digestible pieces. I just wanted to extend a challenge out to anyone reading this. Janene has already agreed to do it with me. If you want to join us, let me know and I'll send you a copy of the schedule.{% include endmark.html %}
