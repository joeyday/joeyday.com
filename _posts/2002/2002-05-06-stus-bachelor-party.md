Well, Stu's getting married this Friday. Can you believe it? I feel kindof bad that I waited so long, but we threw together a little bachelor party for him tonight. Stu, myself, Jared (Shilo's brother), and Jeremy all went to Classic Skating. We've been to Classic a lot but I've never noticed the Polaroid machine. When I saw it I realized we had to have something to capture the memory. Here's the picture in all it's glory.
After skating we all went to my house for pizza and a movie (_Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_). Jess joined us about halfway through the pizza, and stuck around for most of the movie.

I've never been to a bachelor party, but everyone seemed to have fun, so I'd call it a general success. I just want to say congratulations to Stu. May your marriage be a long and healthy one, my friend!{% include endmark.html %}
