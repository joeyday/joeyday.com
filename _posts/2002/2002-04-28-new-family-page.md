I’ve finished my [Family](/family) page. I should’ve had this up a long time ago. I want to tell my family how much I love them. Mom, Dad, Merissa, you each mean so much to me and I can’t say enough how grateful I am for your love and support. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. I love you!{% include endmark.html %}
