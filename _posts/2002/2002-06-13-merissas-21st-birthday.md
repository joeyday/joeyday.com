Today I want to wish my little sister a very happy 21st birthday!

Merissa (A.K.A. Sister-head, Hippy): Wow, you’ve made it to the big two one. I think the last year of your life has been a particularly defining one. As your big brother, I’m pleased with the decisions you’ve made and the things you’ve accomplished. You are a great sister and an even greater friend. Happy Birthday!{% include endmark.html %}
