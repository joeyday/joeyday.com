I just had four cavities filled. Let me tell you I’m not a very happy camper right now. I was kindof worried because he shot me up and left the room, but by the time he got back I could still feel everything. I told him and all he said was, “Well, we’ll start working and if you feel anything we’ll stop and give you more.” I started freaking out, but he’s a good dentist so I trusted him. I felt one of the teeth he drilled, but it didn’t hurt very much. Right now I’m very hungry and I wish I could go to sleep. Unfortunately...

The Final Exam for my online Calculus course is tomorrow! I’ve finished all my assignments so the Final is the only thing left. I’m going to be so happy when this class is over with. I’m never going to take another online class. I’m just the kind of guy who needs a regular lecture in order to learn stuff. As far as I know I still have a “B”, but I don’t have my grade back from Exam III yet. I’ve printed out copies of all the past practice exams to study with. If I do well enough on the Final I can still pull my grade up to an “A”. That would really help my GPA right now.{% include endmark.html %}
