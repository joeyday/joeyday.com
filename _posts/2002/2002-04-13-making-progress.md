I’ve added my implementation of Problem Set 8 to the [Computer Stuff](/computers) page. It was by far the easiest problem set I’ve done all semester. I finished it Thursday in under four hours. I am very happy with it and I think I’ll get a really good score (cross your fingers for me!).

I’ve got my [Music](/music) page up! It’s got links to my favorite bands and some other things worth checking out. Eventually I hope to include recordings of my own music, but it’ll probably be a while.

And in case you aren’t scrutinizing every square inch of my page daily for changes, I should point out that I’ve added a few sites to my [Links](/links) page. I keep finding cool things that are worth adding. I hope it isn’t getting too long...{% include endmark.html %}
