Merry Christmas! I'm putting this entry up at 10pm, and I realize my holiday greetings may be a little belated. I was spending quality time with family and friends, so I don't expect that anyone will think me less of a person for not getting it up sooner. I want to take this opportunity to say Merry Christmas to all of you who read my site. It means a lot to me that you check in on my life from time to time.

I hope all of you were able to take a few moments on this day and honestly reflect on what we've celebrated. The meaning of Christmas is not wrapped up in family and friends, a spirit of giving, and peace for all men (although I wouldn't suggest for a moment that we shouldn't think about and celebrate these things on Christmas). The reason this time of year exists is not so we can give gifts to one another, it is so we can celebrate the greatest gift that was given to usâ€”the gift of God's Son, Jesus Christ. I hope and pray that we can all come to know Him better this Christmas season. God bless!
