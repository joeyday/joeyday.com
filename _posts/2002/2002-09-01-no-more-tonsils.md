Janene’s surgery was a success. There weren’t any complications, and she is recovering well, if not somewhat slowly. She’s very cute right now, curled up in a little ball on her parents’ huge water-bed. She has trouble talking so it comes out as a cute little squeek. What amazes me is the attitude she has toward everyone around her. She has every right to be in a miserable mood being in as much pain as she is, but she is still smiling (although somewhat weakly because her mouth is sore!). She is a beautiful person and I am grateful to know her. Sweetheart: Get well soon. I love you!

My parents are helping me buy a new calculator for my birthday. I decided to go with the Hewlett-Packard 49g. I couldn’t find it at any local office supply stores, so I decided to order it online. I found a great deal at Amazon.com, and my new calculator should be arriving sometime between the 5th and the 11th of September. In the meantime, I’m using the emulator to do my homework.{% include endmark.html %}
