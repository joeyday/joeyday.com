title: "Day 1: Learning the Material"

My first day at ContentWatch was great! My supervisor was kinda busy so she let me look over a lot of the information on my own. They have pretty extensive technical notes on the most frequently asked questions, which means most of what I'll do answering e-mails will be cut and paste. Each e-mail will be tailored some, of course, but when so many people ask the same question there's really no reason to go to the trouble of writing new material each time.

So, today I familiarized myself with our four products: ContentAudit, ContentCleanup, ContentWatch, and ContentMonitor. I also scanned most of the website and the online FAQ's concerning each product. There's also a ton of informational stuff on the website, including articles about objectionable content and how to deal with it in a family setting. I learned a ton!

I'm really excited about this job. I am so grateful to Heavenly Father for the blessing He has given me to be working at ContentWatch.

I have a full day ahead of me tomorrow. I'm working at the high school from 8–10am, then going straight to ContentWatch from 11am–4pm, and then going straight to 5 Buck from 5pm to whenever they get slow enough to let me go home. Yikes!{% include endmark.html %}
