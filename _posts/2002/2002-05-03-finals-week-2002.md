Wow, this week has been a little much for me. It's winding down now, and for that I'm grateful. I just finished the first of my two finals (the Biology one). The second one (my Computer Science final) will be next Wednesday.

I'm trying to figure out what I need for next fall, and I think I'm going to take Calculus I over the Internet this summer. I don't want any scheduled classes, because I plan to spend the summer working to save money for school and whatever else lies ahead.

Anyway, the whole point of putting this entry in was to say that I've added Problem Set 11 (the last one!) to my [Computer Stuff](/computers) page.{% include endmark.html %}
