Janene's Granny was admitted into the hospital last night. She's been bleeding in her digestive system and began vomiting around 5pm Friday night, and still hasn't stopped (as of noon today) despite being given nausea relief medications. Doctors are worried that her blood is too thin, but because of her history of strokes, it is careful work to thicken her blood without going too far.

Basically the reason I'm telling you this is to ask all of you to please pray for Granny. Pray that she can be comfortable and sleep in the hospital. Pray that her doctors will have sound minds and a keen understanding of her medical needs. Please pray above all that God's will can be done, and that He will show Himself in this trying situation. In my experience it is after these hard times that one can look back and see that God's hand was working in ways that were never expected. Pray for miracles to happen. I know that they can and will.
