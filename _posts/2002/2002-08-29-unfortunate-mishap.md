My calculator (An HP 48gx, for those who don’t know) has been in my glove box for the past week or two, and last night I went to get it out so I could use it to complete some Physics homework. Come to find out, the screen has been busted! There is a crack running the entire width of the screen, and a great big black splotch where the LCD stuff oozed out all over the view area. Doesn’t that just sound lovely?

So, I need to buy a new calculator, and seeing as how it is probably the last calculator I’ll ever buy, I think I want a nice one. I’ve considered both the TI-89 and the HP 49g, and I’m starting to lean toward the HP, mostly because It is a lot like my old one with a lot of cool new features.

Anyway, I need some help deciding. Check out these sites (or find some of your own) and let me know what you think: Pros, Cons, Comparison. I also found a nifty little Emulator and downloaded it to play around. I can’t really get a feel for it until I can wrap my fingers around one, but I suppose this is the next best thing!
