title: Too Many Jobs

This week has been a rush. On Tuesday I worked all three of my jobs (West Jordan High from 8–10am, ContentWatch from 11am–4pm, and 5 Buck from 5pm–11pm), Wednesday was a little calm in the storm (excluding the parade from 7am–1pm), and Thursday I worked two jobs (ContentWatch from 9am–5pm, and 5 Buck from 6–9pm). Today I worked at ContentWatch from 9am–5pm. Whew! I think I'm too used to this summer thing. I hate to think of what I will be like when school starts up again.

I finished my job at the high school on Wednesday. The parade went well. The Days of ’47 Parade is a lot longer than any others we did this year, and it was pretty hot. However, the drumline performed well in the heat. I am very honored to have worked with them this summer and I hope I can visit them at a few of their competitions this fall.

My first week at ContentWatch has gone very well. I found a neat program that extends the functionality of the windows clipboard, allowing you to store an unlimited number of items. It then lets you organize your clips in a file tree category system for easy retrieval later on. It also has really slick hot-key functionality. I've organized all my tech notes, and now I can create an entire e-mail with just a few keystrokes. I showed it to Karma and she's going to buy it for all the tech support people in the office.{% include endmark.html %}
