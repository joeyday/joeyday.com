WOW! I started my job at 5 Buck Friday night and in three hours-totalling my wage, tips, and gas reimbursement-I made almost $20 an hour! It’s the easiest job I’ve ever had and it was pretty fun. The only drawback I’m seeing at the moment is that I don’t really get to socialize with my co-workers. Ninety-five percent of my time was spent in my car. I didn’t get lost and I was able to do thirteen deliveries, which I guess is pretty good for my first night. I work there again today so I’ll get to see if Mondays are as good as Friday was.

So now I’m thinking of quitting at Guadalahonky’s. I’m only making minimum wage there and I don’t feel like I’m picking up the job very quickly. I work with a bunch of high school girls and they know what they are doing way better than I do. I just don’t feel like I fit in very well. I would really like to stick around as long as I can and wait for a server position, but if they can’t promote me to server soon, why stay?{% include endmark.html %}
