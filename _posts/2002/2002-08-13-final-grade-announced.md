title:  Final Grade Announced

I’m so HAPPY right now! I got my final score back from my online Calculus class. My score on the Final Exam was a 92, and my final grade in the class is an “A”! My final score was an 89% and the professor mentioned he “upscaled this number to compensate for some of the difficulties you had to face this semester”. I can only assume he means the flooding at the new math building last month.

I really should’ve got a “B”, but I’m very grateful for the professor’s generosity. I can’t end this without also thanking my Heavenly Father for His generosity. He blesses me every day, sometimes very visibly, and other times that I may not even notice. All good things come from Him, and I am so thankful.{% include endmark.html %}
