I’ve updated the [Computer Stuff](/computers) page to include Problem Set 10. I was up until 5am this morning doing it, and it was worth it. I feel very good about the final product.

Well, this semester is almost over. I’m really looking forward to this summer and the chance to just work hard and save money. However, everything is starting to really come down to the wire, and I’m stretching myself to keep from getting pulled under. I feel really unprepared for my biology final. I haven’t cracked the book in a while and I’ve had so many other things going on that I haven’t really had time. Between my writing group project and my computer science assignment, this weekend was horrible!

Anyway, I know a lot of the people who read my site also have finals these next couple weeks and I want to wish everyone luck! Know also that I’m praying for all of us to make it through this in one piece. May God bless you all...{% include endmark.html %}
