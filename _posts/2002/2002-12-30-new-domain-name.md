It's official. I am now the proud owner of [JoeyDay.com](http://www.joeyday.com). I completed the purchase about an hour ago, but as far as I can tell the domain isn't working yet. As soon as it's up I'll be moving my whole site over there. I may leave Qangaroo.com up for another month (with a message and an automatic redirect to JoeyDay.com), but I can't keep it up for too long since I'd have to continue to pay for the hosting.

From what I understand, Janene's Granny is doing better. She is on a new medication that seems to be working. They may be discharging her tomorrow, but we are still not sure. Janene and I will be visiting her later tonight. I want to thank everyone for thinking about her and praying for her. Please continue to pray with us that she can have a speedy recovery and that this new medication will not cause any further complications.{% include endmark.html %}
