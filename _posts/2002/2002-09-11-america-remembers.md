I took my car in Monday to have new brakes put in (they were making an awful scraping noise), and to see what could be done about my "random multiple-cylinder misfires". They replaced the brakes, but the guy said he didn't even want to touch the other problem. He said he had another Stratus come in with identical symptoms, and replacing the plugs, the wires, and the distributor didn't fix a thing. So I made an appointment with the local Dodge Service Center. They said they had a few ideas, but if they can't fix it I don't have any idea what I'll do. I'm just praying that whatever happens it will all turn out for the better.

I can't believe it's been a year. It was really weird to walk through the Student Union Building today. I walk through it every day, but today was different because that's where I was when I first found out what was going on exactly one year ago today. The marching band played a selection of patriotic songs this afternoon in front of the Union building, and then there was a little presentation and memorial thingy. It was good to sit back and listen to the patriotic songs that we've all heard a million times, and just think about everything that's happened over the past year.

I don't want to drive this point into the ground—I'm sure everyone has heard enough today—but I do want to at least express my gratitude to a loving Heavenly Father, who has put in a lot of overtime to comfort and support all those who were affected in any way by those tragic events. He is a faithful God, and although He will not always come to our aid on the earthly battlefield (at least in the ways we would want Him to), if we will but ask He will rescue us on every spiritual battlefield. May God continue to bless our country, our leaders, and the American people. This is my prayer.{% include endmark.html %}
