Dad: You are one of my best friends. Most of my fondest memories are of camping and hiking trips we took together. I don't think camping would've been the same without your stories and harmonica playing.

I remember one day you told me that if I ever wanted to drink a beer that I should call you and you'd try it with me. That has always stuck with me and to this day I think if I ever did want to try beer I really would give you a call. I'm sure you would talk me out of it, but I guess that's the whole reason you said that.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that you've always been a wonderful example to me and I really appreciate that. I love you!{% include endmark.html %}
