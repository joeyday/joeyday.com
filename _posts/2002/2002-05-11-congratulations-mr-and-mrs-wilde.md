Well, Stu's wedding went off without a hitch. I'm very happy for him and his new bride. Stu and Shilo: I have enjoyed watching your friendship grow and blossom into a beautiful romance. I wish you both a very long and happy life together! (And don't forget about me while you are paying so much attention to each other, okay?){% include endmark.html %}
