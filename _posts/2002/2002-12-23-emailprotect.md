ContentWatch released it's newest product today—[EmailProtect](http://www.qksrv.net/click-1180654-9960192). EmailProtect will block objectionable material from entering any POP email program (such as Outlook, Eudora, Netscape Communicator, etc.). It also has a very powerful rules system to handle junk mail. I'm really anxious to put this program on my computer.

Working during the day is a little different for me. I guess it's just because I'm not used to working eight hours straight. I'm ready for Christmas now just so I'll get a few days off. I just got off the phone with a guy who shouldn't be allowed near a computer. You know how they have background checks when you want to buy a gun? Well, they should have IQ checks when you want to buy a computer. I guess I don't really mean that—I'm just a little frustrated right now.

Janene and I spent last night with my family decorating the Christmas tree. My dad wanted to do it the way he used to when he was a kid. We threaded popcorn onto dental floss and made green and red paper chains. My dad even covered our tree-topper star (what else do you call that?) with tin foil so it would look more like the cardboard star he had as a kid. My mom does our tree different each year, and she's good at making it look really nice. It's kindof strange to see such a makeshift tree, but it was fun putting it together. We got some good pictures when we were all done. I'll have to see if I can convince my mom to let me post them here.{% include endmark.html %}
