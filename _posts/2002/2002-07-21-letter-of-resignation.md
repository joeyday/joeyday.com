title: Letter of Resignation
date: 2002-07-21
---

The math server is back online at the University. To compensate for lost time they've moved all of the due dates forward by one week and cancelled the last assignment. Actually, they've made the last assignment available online, but they aren't going to require us to do it. The material for that assignment won't be included on the Final Exam. So, all is well, but my little break is over. ðŸ˜Ÿ

I turned in a resignation letter at 5 Buck. That was so hard. I feel horrible to be leaving there. They have treated me extremely well and I really enjoyed my job. I will definitely treasure these last two weeks.

Anyway, I guess I should be getting to that homework...{% include endmark.html %}
