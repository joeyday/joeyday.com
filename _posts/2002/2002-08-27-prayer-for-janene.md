title:  Prayer for Janene

I want to take a moment to ask for everyone’s prayers on behalf of Janene this weekend. She’ll be going in for surgery on Friday, August 30. She’s had Chronic Sinusitis since her childhood, which is basically a costant Sinus Infection. The infection causes scar tissue to form in her Sinuses. These Irritations are called “Polyps”, and in rare cases have been known to be cancerous. She’s had surgeries to remove Polyps about every two or three years since she was little, and none of hers have ever been cancerous.

This time it seems to be markedly worse (it’s only been a year and a half since her last surgery). Her doctor has concluded that this is due in part to her Tonsils. They are very swollen right now, and are probably causing even more infection to get backed up into her Sinuses. Therefore, on top of removing the Polyps, the surgery on Friday will include removal of her Tonsils. I think we’ve all heard about how bad it is to have your Tonsils removed as you get older.

Anyway, I just want to lift this request up to Heavenly Father, and ask that everyone join me in praying that she will be okay and that her recovery time will be minimal. Thanks everyone.
