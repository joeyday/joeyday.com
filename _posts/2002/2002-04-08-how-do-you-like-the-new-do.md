I created some spiffy new title images. What do you think? It’s been a while since I’ve done any updating around here on account of work and school, so I thought I’d do something different.

I have added Problem Set 7 to the Computer Stuff page. I suppose I had fun implementing it, but I would’ve had more fun if I hadn’t been so worried about a research paper for my writing class :(.

I’ve also finally added a Pets page (albeit it’s still a little broken). This place is coming together slowly but surely. As always, keep checking back...{% include endmark.html %}
