It's actually 1:43am on Saturday, June 8, but I wanted to get this up anyway. I want to wish my sweetheart, Janene, a happy anniversary. Today (or what still feels like today, June 7) is the one year anniversary of our first date.

Janene: We have had a few ups and downs this past year. Our friendship is the common thread that runs through them all. My hope and prayer is that we can continue to grow as God would have us to. You are the love of my life. I love you!{% include endmark.html %}
