I had a great birthday on Wednesday. If you forgot about it, that's okay. I didn't remind anyone because I really didn't want people making a big deal out of it. It was a rather quiet birthday spent with close friends and family, and I really did enjoy myself.

Janene's family gave me a Lava Lamp for my birthday. Just what I've always wanted! I've placed it on my desk at work so I can show it off. It is very relaxing.

Janene is doing great. She had an appointment with her doctor yesterday and he gave her a clean bill of health. He says her recovery is one of the best he's ever seen. She's still experiencing some pain and discomfort (especially when she swallows!), but is no longer taking the pain pills because they make her awfully drowsy and non-functional.

Again, we are grateful for all of your support and prayers. I'm confident that God has blessed Janene with this swift recovery as a direct result of your prayer and faith on her behalf. I also want to thank Heavenly Father. Without Him we would be so hopeless and lost on this little ball of dust. He is amazing in His willingness to bless us with everything we have, including and especially the opportunity to live with Him someday.
