Today, Janene and I have been together for a year and six months. It seems like I have known her forever, yet the first time we held hands still feels like yesterday. I'm still every bit in love with her now as I was then, and so much more.

Janene: I want you to know that I love you very much. This last year and a half I've been having the time of my life. You have taught me so much about who I am and who I need to become. You have set such an amazing example for me of a person who is close to her Heavenly Father and really strives to do the things He requires. You truly are a beautiful person, and I think some of that beauty is due to an inner peace and the glow that comes from knowing who you are and who He is. I love you very much, sweetheart. Happy Anniversary! ❤️{% include endmark.html %}
