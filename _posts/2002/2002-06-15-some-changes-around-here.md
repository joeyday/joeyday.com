title: Some Changes Around Here

Well, there were a few things about this website that had bothered me for some time, so this morning I finally fixed them.

For one, you should notice I removed the welcome text from the top of this page. I hope this means no one will have to scroll down anymore to read the newest journal entries. If you are desperate to read the welcome praragraph, it can now be found on the [About](/about) page (which incindentally, has been renamed from 'About Me').

Second, I've added a little home icon to the bottom of each page. Sometimes when you navigate onto the site from search engines you will only get part of the page, and you won't be able to see the menu on the left (this is a nasty side-effect of the way I'm using frames...for an example click [here](/images/pets)). The home icon reloads the whole thing so that you won't just be stuck in one place.

Hope these improvements make things easier (although most likely no one cares but me, and that's okay ðŸ˜Š).{% include endmark.html %}
