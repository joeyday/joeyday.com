I hope everyone had a good Christmas. I sure did. I got all kinds of cool stuff. Janene gave me a Michael W. Smith CD and a very nice shirt to wear to church (her sisters got me a matching tie). Santa brought me the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVD, along with the Back to the Future Trilogy on DVD. I also got a thing called a [ThumbDrive](http://www.memorex.com/products/product_display.php?cid=165&pid=434&oid=501). It's made by Memorex, and it is a small plug and play USB device that holds 128MB. It will be nice for transporting files back and forth between home and school. I update Qangaroo.com from several different locations, so being able to keep it on the ThumbDrive will make things a lot easier. So I guess now you can ask me, "Is that 128MB in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?". ðŸ˜Š

I hope no one thinks I'm going off about all these material things because they were the best part of my Christmas. The best part was being able to spend it with my friends and family. Steve and Merissa came home for the weekend and we've been playing games and watching movies all week. I've also been able to hang out a lot over at Janene's house with all of her family doing the same. Janene's Granny is a riot!

Anyway, it looks like 2003 is right around the corner, eh? When I look back on all that has happened this year I have to conclude that this has been one of the most important years I've ever lived. I've made some decisions this year that will carry me through the rest of my life. I can only hope that 2003 will be half the year 2002 has been.
