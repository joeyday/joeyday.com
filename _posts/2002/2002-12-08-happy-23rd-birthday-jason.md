I want to wish my friend Jason a very happy 23rd birthday. Jason: I don't know if you read my website regularly anymore, but I just want to let you know I'm thinking about you today. I hope and pray that this day finds you in good health and that you can rejoice in another year spent with good friends and family. Happy birthday, bro!

I heard a good story in church today. The story takes place around Christmas, and is about a man who works at the post office. His wife had passed away a few months earlier. He was going through all the letters written to Santa Claus, and he came across one written from his own address. He immediately realized it was from his daughter. He opened the letter and this is what it said, "Dear Santa, my mother passed away two months ago and since then my dad has cried himself to sleep every night. He says that only eternity can heal him. Could you please send a little eternity to my dad this Christmas?".

I like this story because sometimes I feel like I could use a little eternity in my life. I think we all can. What's amazing to me is that Christ was not only a little eternity, He was all of eternity, and He gave himself for us. That is what Christmas is about. His life, sacrifice, and resurrection should be the focus of our thoughts year round, but especially this month. May we all be awakened to a new sense of wonder this Christmas season.
