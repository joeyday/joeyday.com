title: My Car is Fixed!
date: 2002-06-12

I am the happiest kid on the planet right now! Janene has a cousin who is a mechanic at a local Dodge dealership. He's been looking at my car for a few weeks now checking a few things that may be the problem. He wasn't able to find the problem so he finally decided to just do the tune-up for me tonight. My car now runs perfectly!

The parts for the tune-up cost me about $90, which is a far-cry from the $752 Firestone wanted to charge me to fix the problem. I know this is a blessing from the Lord, and I count myself deeply indebted to Him for everything He does for me on a regular basis.{% include endmark.html %}
