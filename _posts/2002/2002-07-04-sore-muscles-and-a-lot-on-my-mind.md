I have had a long couple of days! My whole body feels like mush right now, and I could really use some sleep. I went with Janene to the airport yesterday morning. She will be in New York City until next Tuesday. Her family got a nice package deal on tickets and hotel accomodations. Her mom grew up in New Jersey so they are going to take a day and see the places where she grew up. From talking with her on the phone, it sounds like sheâ€™s having a lot of fun, but I miss her. ðŸ˜Ÿ

I feel like mush for three reasons. First, I marched in the parade last night with the drumline. I really just wanted to walk alongside so I could help with tempo and other things the drumline needs cleaning on, but the cymbal player wasnâ€™t able to come so I ended up marching and playing cymbals. Let me tell you, marching cymbals is no picnic. They are heavy and the straps cause a fair amount of bruising.

Second, after the parade last night I did something most of you will find slightly insane. There is a local bowling alley that holds an all-night youth activity about once a month. They do this on holidays when kids are out of school. Basically you show up around midnight and they lock everyone in until 6am the next morning. Entrance costs about 20 bucks. It includes shoes and unlimited games, plus they provide pizza at the beginning, free drinks all night long, and a continental breakfast toward sun up. It was a lot of fun, but I acquired a headache after the first hour which placed a damper on the rest of the night.

Finally, at 6:30am I met with the band for yet another parade. Once again I marched cymbals. By the time we were done I was ready to keel over. Of course, this parade was shorter than the first one, so it wasnâ€™t all that bad. The good part was I got to go home and sleep afterward. Iâ€™m doing much better now, although like I said, Iâ€™m very sore.

Anyway, before I go to bed I just wanted to wish everyone a happy Independence Day! I have a deep respect for our country and our freedoms. I am saddened by some peoplesâ€™ attempts as of late to weaken our countryâ€™s relationship with our Heavenly Father. Our nation certainly cannot claim to be Godâ€™s chosen people any more than any other nation, but I have a strong belief that we could not have survived this long without His support, guidance, and protection. It is the moment we turn away from Him that we will find ourselves with no ability to defend the freedoms that we enjoy today. I love my Heavenly Father, and I love this great nation. God Bless America!{% include endmark.html %}
