Hm... I never get any e-mail anymore. Hey, let's have a little contest. Whoever you are, drop everything you're doing right now and send me an e-mail. I don't care if it's blank (although I wouldn't mind a quick update or at least a hello). Whoever sends the first e-mail gets a free lunch on me. Good Luck!{% include endmark.html %}

[Update: My cousin Steve out in Michigan was the winner of the contest. Thanks to all three people who participated (I'm such a loser), and Congratulations to Steve!]
