title: But Wait, It Gets Worse...

When it rains, it pours! I went out to lunch yesterday with a friend, and when I got home my computer was turned off. I thought someone here at the house had turned it off. Turns out, we had experienced a power outage. When I tried to turn my computer on it wouldn't boot up. I tried several different boot options, but it wouldn't even boot in safe mode! At that point I knew I would have to take it into the shop.

Fixing it is no big deal. It was purchased at Totally Awesome Computers and it has a three year warranty on parts so I'll be able to get it fixed for nothing. However, I was really worried about my files. Fortunately, I was able to get it to boot succesfully this morning. I've backed up all of my important files and I'm about to take it in. I have no idea if I'll even be able to get it to boot again. I've been having lots of problems lately with my fan. It makes a horribly loud noise. I suspect that my power supply was gradually dying, and this power outage was the last straw. Of course, I really have no idea what's going on. That'll be up to the guys down at the shop.

Anyway, my whole purpose in writing this entry is to say that I may not be updating my website for a little while, depending on how well things go with my computer. If nothing else, I can use another computer around here to keep you all posted, so it shouldn't be a big deal. Everyone wish me luck!{% include endmark.html %}
