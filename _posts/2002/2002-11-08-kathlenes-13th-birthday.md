It was Kathlene's birthday yesterday, and I want to take this opportunity to wish her a very happy birthday!

Kathlene: I have known you for almost a year and a half now, and in that time I've seen you grow a lot more than you probably realize. You have become an exceptional young woman, and I am proud to be your friend. Never forget to pray and read your scriptures. It sounds so simple, but I can promise you it will have a huge impact on your life. Happy Birthday!

I went to a hockey game with Janene's family tonight to celebrate Kathlene's birthday. It was my first hockey game, and I'm happy to report that I understand most of the major rules, and I was even able to anticipate a few of the calls before the referee made them. Hockey has a lot more to it than just a bunch of guys beating each other up (although we shouldn't overlook thatâ€”it is kindof funny to see how mad they get ðŸ˜€). It actually requires a lot of skill and quick reflexes, and is, in my opinion, very entertaining. In fact, I think it'd be fun to have season tickets someday when I'm not so busy with school and work.{% include endmark.html %}
