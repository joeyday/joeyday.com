I had a somewhat eventful weekend. I lost my debit card last Thursday, so I've been trying to sort all of that out. I haven't called the bank to cancel it yet, and according to my online statement, there haven't been any unauthorized charges (knock on wood). I think I left it at the IHC. I called over there and no one there has seen it. I'll probably call the bank tomorrow to cancel the card and get a new one.

Speaking of IHC, I went and saw my doctor on Thursday. He didn't really tell me what was wrong with me, but he's going to make me an appointment with an allergist, and he gave me some nose spray (the addictive kind, yay!) and some allergy medication.

Stuart and I went to the X96 Big Ass Show on Saturday. My first concert ever. I was actually in a mosh pit for about 2 minutes. It was an experience I hope to never have again, but I'm glad that I've done it at least once. The bands sounded okay, but the one band I really wanted to see (Unwritten Law) sounded awful. I don't think anybody can ever sound as good on stage as they do in the recording studio. It just can't be done. I had a lot of fun, and the ticket was only eleven bucks, so for ten bands it was certainly worth the money.{% include endmark.html %}
