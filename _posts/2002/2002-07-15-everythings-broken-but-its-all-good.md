My computer won't boot this morning. I'm pretty sure it's overheating. I'm going to take it down to Totally Awesome Computers today and have them replace the processor fan. The computer is still on a three year warranty for parts and labor so they'll do the work for free.

Also, I have yet another flat tire. It's either my third or fourth since I started working for 5 Buck, I've lost track. The cool part is my mom got a thingy in the mail for a free flat tire repair down at David Early Tires. What a blessing! So I'll be taking my car down there this afternoon.

Speaking of blessings, the server went down at the University's math department, so they told all of us online students to "keep studying from the book" until they can readjust the assignment schedule. I think a lot of the webwork is actually based on a server in Rochester, so I need to check on whether or not I can still do my homework, but if the server's down it means I won't have any homework for a while. ðŸ˜€

Last but not least, I've put up some pictures of Janene in [New York](/friends/janene/newyork). I think they turned out really great. She had a lot of fun and hopes she can go back someday. Anyway, enjoy the pictures!{% include endmark.html %}
