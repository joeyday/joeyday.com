title: Resignation at Guad’s
date: 2002-04-24

Well, I went and did it. I quit my job at Guadalahonky’s. I turned in my two weeks today, which means my last day will be Wednesday, May 8. My dad is looking into getting me a job with ContentWatch doing technical support. I figure that will be a much better summer job. The pay will probably be better than Guad’s, and it’ll be computer industry experience to list on a resume someday. Either way that translates to a win for me. Needless to say I’m really excited. :D

I’ve put up a temporary Writing 2010 page. I’m working with a group to write a research paper on the effects of caffeine on the human body. This site should help facilitate communication between group members for purposes of continuity and accuracy. For more information follow the link.{% include endmark.html %}

\[Update: The Writing 2010 page was dismembered sometime around May 1. I’ve still got all the files, so if you really need access to them, feel free to [email me](mailto:writing2010@joeyday.com).\]
