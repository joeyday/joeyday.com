title: Cast All Your Anxiety on Him

Today was the last day of a four day clinic for the West Jordan High School drumline. I sat in on the clinic, but it was taught by a guy named Sam Santistevens. Most of the drumline members are sophomores with no previous percussion experience, so Sam covered the basics, and the line just ate it all up. I'm excited to teach this drumline over the summer. They have a hunger for learning. If they can continue progressing at the rate they have been this week, they will be incredible! I only hope I can be some small measure of the kind of teacher Sam is.

I also took my first exam today for my online Calculus class. I was fairly confident about the concepts and ideas that have been covered so far, but I was somewhat apprehensive about taking the exam because I didn't really know what to expect. I updated the scripture of the day, 1 Peter 5:6-7, this morning, without even thinking about my exam. I didn't realize that the idea of "casting all my anxiety" on the Lord would come in handy. Coming out of the exam I felt very good. In fact, I would be surprised if I don't get 100%. I know the ability to learn and understand things is a gift from the Lord, and I'm thankful that He calmed my anxiety today.{% include endmark.html %}
