Today is my sister’s wedding day. She is one of my best friends. I’ve seen her grow so much in the 20 years we’ve known each other. Never have I seen her more beautiful than today. Steve and Merissa: I want to congratulate both of you and extend my best wishes for a happy life together. I love you!{% include endmark.html %}
