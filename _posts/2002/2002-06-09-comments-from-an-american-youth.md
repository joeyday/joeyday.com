title: Comments From an American Youth
date: 2002-06-09

Today I had some time to kill, so I asked my girlfriend and her family what I should put on my website. I was surprised by the thoughtful response I received from her twelve year old sister, Kathlene. She has written some comments about September 11 and asked me to post them here.

The September 11 terrorism attack on the World Trade Center had a deep impact on a lot of American children. Kathlene's father served in the Navy when he was younger, and she has very strong feelings about our country and our freedoms. These are the thoughts of children across America. May we all listen and learn from them.{% include endmark.html %}

_A letter written by Janene's 12 year old sister, Kathlene._

September 11 was a sad day for America. Families getting calls from loved ones saying goodbye. So many people lost and yet to be found, but many didn't survive. America had so many questions like, "Why did they do this?", or "Who did this?", but some did not seem clear.

People all over America found ways to help: police, firemen, news reporters. America will never be the same! People realized how important life was. They also came closer together.

It not only affected New York; it affected everyone in America. The memorial service was something. It made me realize that so many people risk their lives for their country, including my dad. America is the land of the free and the home of the brave.

September 11 also changed me deeply. It helped me to appreciate America more. It also put me closer to God in prayer. God allowed this to happen for a reason. I think it was so it would bring America closer together.

The flag is so important to me because it represents many things to me. When I see a flag it sometimes brings tears to my eyes. I always wear red, white, and blue.

Be proud that you live in America. Stand tall. Love this country. Thank God for your life. Pray for families that lost loved ones, and pray for people who fought for you and still are.

Be proud to be an American.
