Well, a couple days ago I got a call from the management at [5 Buck Pizza](http://www.ut-biz.com/5buckpizza), a local Pizza store. I put in an application for a driver position a month ago and they were calling me to see if I still wanted the job. I haven't been getting very many hours at my other job and I was actually going to go apply at a few places to find a second job. It was perfect timing that they called me when they did.

I went in for an interview Monday night and I got the job! I think I'll really like working there. Janene worked there for three years so I know a lot of the people that work there and the management is really great. I should be able to make pretty good money delivering. They'll pay for my gas and I get to keep my tips. I'm excited to start on Friday.

I've also decided on a day to have our hike up Grandeur Peak. I don't want to put the date up here for safety reasons, but I think it will be the perfect time to go. If you still want in or have questions, feel free to e-mail me ([news@joeyday.com](mailto:news@joeyday.com)).{% include endmark.html %}
