Janene came home on Monday. She and her family had tons of fun in New York. They got to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, as well as every other New York landmark you can think of. She brought me back an "I ❤️ NY" shot glass, as well as a little bottle of beach sand and sea shells. I think her favorite part of the trip was the time she spent in New Jersey with her Uncle Tom and Aunt Gina. It was her first trip on a plane, and it's the farthest she's ever been away from home. I think it was really good for her, but I'm very glad she made it home safely.

My "Check Engine" light shut off the other day and has stayed off since then. I don't know if I should be happy, or if I should worry even more than before. I think I'll run it down to AutoZone and have them look at it to make sure it's okay. Either way, I think having the light turn off is a sign that something good is happening.

I'm so grateful to my Heavenly Father for the blessings He gives me every day—every hour. He is so generous to me, even when I am completely undeserving. I know I can never repay Him, but my prayer is that I can accomplish the tasks He places before me, so that His will can be done in my life, and the lives of those around me.{% include endmark.html %}
