My grandmother went into the hospital last weekend. Apparently she suffered a minor stroke. The hospital had a CAT scan done, and depending on the results they were going to life flight her to a different hospital (she lives in a very small town about two hours away from any major medical facilities). Fortunately, the tests didn't show anything, so they didn't have to do that. From what I've heard up to this point she is recovering and will probably be released very soon.

My grandma's getting very old, and she keeps saying that she is ready to go. I think if it came down to it, she probably wouldn't fight it. I'm having trouble deciding whether I'm okay with that or not. I don't want her to die, but I imagine if I were in her position I would probably feel the same way.

My calculator came in the mail last Friday. I figured out how to get all the programs out of my old calculator into the new one, and I've been downloading software for it. Having not even touched one before buying (I did all my shopping online), I was somewhat nervous that I might not like it. So far, however, I've been very impressed with it, and expect it to serve me well through the rest of my college years, and, hopefully, the rest of my life (my dad still uses the programmable calculator he bought in college!).
