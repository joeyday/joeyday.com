Yesterday was a good day. I picked up my computer from Totally Awesome and it seems to be running much better. The fan no longer makes that horrible noise and it hasn't locked up since it's been home. Out of sheer curiosity I asked the guy how much it would cost to upgrade to a new processor. He said they could put a 1.8 GHz processor in for around $280. That's pretty cheap, considering it'd be like getting a brand new computer. Too bad I don't have the money. ðŸ˜Ÿ

I also went to Seven Peaks with my sister and her husband yesterday. There was some bad weather right when we got into the park. For a little while they had the slides and pools evacuated for lightning, but it cleared up and we got a good two or three hours of fun. I had a blast, but I woke up this morning with bruises all over my back. Most of the slides have seams between each section of tubing. Ouch. ðŸ˜£

I interviewed with ContentWatch on Wednesday. I think it went well and now I'm waiting for any contact. She said she only had to interview one other person, and that was supposed to happen yesterday, so I could get a call any minute with a yes or a no. It's kindof suspenseful, but I know Heavenly Father will take care of me no matter what happens, and that whether I get the job or not, I have to trust and completely accept His will if I'm to be truly happy. I'm leaving this one in His hands.{% include endmark.html %}
