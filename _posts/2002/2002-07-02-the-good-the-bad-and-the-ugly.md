I have to admit that yesterday I was a little worried whether or not the drumline would be entirely ready for the parade tomorrow. My worries were blown away after seeing them today. I've never seen them improve so much overnight. Most of the basses were still using their music yesterday because they didn't have the songs memorized. Today they marched and played for almost three hours straight with no music. They hardly missed a beat and they sounded great! Now I'm really looking forward to the parade tomorrow.

I haven't mentioned this yet, and I should say something about it before I forget. The "Check Engine" light in my car came on again this week. I don't know what I'm going to do. At this point the only thing left to replace is the distributorâ€”and it could cost $500! I'm going to have to call Janene's cousin again. I guess we'll see what happens here in the next couple weeks...

Last but not least, I've added a new section to my website. I have always had a fascination with vocabulary, and I have wanted to put this up for a while but never got around to it. It is a list of useful Words that have fallen out of common usage. It is my opinion that these words must come back!{% include endmark.html %}
