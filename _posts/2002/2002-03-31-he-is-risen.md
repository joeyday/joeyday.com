I sincerely hope that all of you will have an extremely enjoyable Easter, and that you wonâ€™t get too sick from all the goodies. At the same time I hope that we can all gain a greater appreciation for the gift our Father in Heaven has given us through His son Jesus Christ. This is a time of year for quiet reflection and thoughts of Him. I know that He is our Redeemer, that what He did for us on the cross ensures us that there will always be a way back to His presence. I know that He did die, but that three days later He rose from the dead and lives even to this day. He is my Savior and my friend, and I will forever be grateful to Him. Happy Easter!{% include endmark.html %}
