I completely bombed an exam today for my online Calculus class. I feel just horrible about it. The exam was on related rates and applications of the derivative—finding minimums and maximums, inflection points, and so on. I didn't study near as much as I should have. The clincher was when I went to turn on my calculator halfway through the exam. I guess I must've left it in my car a little too long, cuz the batteries are fried—as in fluid has leaked all over the inside of the battery compartment! ACK. :eek

On a more positive note, check out the spiffy ticker thingy at the top of the page. I discovered it on a free DHTML script site called [Simply The Best Scripts](http://www.simplythebest.net/info/scripts.html). It took me almost an hour to tweak the stupid thing, but I did it, and I feel very good about the final product. So, if you don't like it that's just too bad!

I've been experimenting with a program called 1st Page 2000, and it's really starting to grow on me. It's a free HTML authoring tool put out by a company called EVRSoft, and a friend from church suggested that I try it. I've had bad experiences with other website building tools and finally settled on a slightly upscaled clone of notepad called NoteTab. However, the more I tinker with 1st Page, the more I just love it. If you're into web design, I've included links on my [Computers](/computers) page. Check it out!{% include endmark.html %}
