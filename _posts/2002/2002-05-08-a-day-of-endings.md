title: A Day of Endings

Today has been a day of endings for me. I took my last final (in computer science) this morning, and I worked my last shift at Guadalahonky's tonight. I am glad for the semester to be over, but not so glad to quit my job. I've really enjoyed the people I worked with, and the food at Guad's is pretty good. I'll definately have to stop in from time to time to say hello.

Hopefully next week will be a week of beginnings for me, but that remains to be seen. I haven't had any calls from iAccess, yet. I told them I'd be available to start next Monday (May 13) so I guess I really should be giving them a call soon, eh?{% include endmark.html %}
