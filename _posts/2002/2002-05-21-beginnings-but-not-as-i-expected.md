I heard from ContentWatch last week. They aren't hiring right now, and probably won't be for a while. However, I've found a job with West Jordan High School. I'm going to be the summer Drumline Instructor. Stu's little brother, Herschel, is on the line this year, and I've met a few of the other guys. Although I am wary of the whole "super-senior" aspect of the job, I think it will be lots of fun. I've decided I'm going to wear a tie to work every day so that they will respect me. There are a few parades in the evening, but other than that, this job won't interfere with my other job. I'm very happy about that.

I've also registered for Calculus I this summer. I'm taking the class online, and so far I'm very impressed with the way the whole system is set up. There are tons of resources available to help me learn in the absence of regular formal lectures. Only time will tell whether or not I'm motivated to do well, but I think it's going to be fun.{% include endmark.html %}
