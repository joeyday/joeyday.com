I got a call from ContentWatch about an hour ago. I got the job! I will start on Monday, and for the next two weeks they will work around my schedule at 5 Buck and the high school. After that—around the first of August—I'll work every weeknight from 5pm to 9pm. I'm so sad to be leaving 5 Buck. It has been an excellent job. On the other hand, I'm extremely excited for this new opportunity and hope I can fulfill my responsibilities admirably.{% include endmark.html %}
