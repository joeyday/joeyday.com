Check out this cool picture I got in my e-mail! It’s the new World Trade Center Memorial. As far as I know (from what I heard on the news) the memorial is temporary and will stand for two months. I’m not sure what will be done after that, whether a permanent memorial will be built or whether there are plans to put something else in it’s place. I hope it stays, cause it sure looks cool.

I’ve added some information to my [Computer Stuff](/computers) page. You can now download my solution to Problem Set 4. I’m having tons of fun implementing Problem Set 5. Be sure and check back next week and I’ll probably have that posted.{% include endmark.html %}
