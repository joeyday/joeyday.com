I don’t know why, but the “omnis” of God have always held a sort of fascination for me ((I guess, really, the attributes of God in general have always fascinated me. I started, but never finished, reading a book called <cite>[What is God?: An Investigation into the Perfections of God’s Nature](http://amzn.com/1845502280/?tag=joeyday-20)</cite>, a survey of all God’s attributes—[immanence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence), [transcendence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_%28religion%29), [aseity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aseity), etc. Fascinating stuff. I should pick that book up again.)). I think everybody has heard of three of them: [omnipotence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence) (all-powerful), [omniscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience) (all-knowing), and [omnipresence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipresence) (everywhere-present). A couple years ago I stumbled upon [omnibenevolence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence) (all-good).

I’ve been reading the book of Job and got a little mind-boggled this morning and went looking for context and background to help me understand what I was reading. I started with \[Wikipedia\], not because I think it’s a really good resource for understanding the scriptures, but just because it’s as good a place as any to start. Lo and behold, in the Wikipedia article on the [Book of Job](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job), I came across two “omnis” I had never heard before: [omnisapience](http://www.theopedia.com/Wisdom_of_God) (all-wise), and omniliberty (all-sovereign, or all-free—able to do whatever he pleases), though I can’t seem to find omniliberty anywhere else on the Internet, and wonder if whoever added it to Wikipedia just made it up ((See this [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22omniliberty%22). Interestingly, this post is already the number one result after having been published a little under two hours ago! Virtually all other results are copies/quotes of the Book of Job Wikipedia article.)).

Are there other “omnis” I’ve never heard of? Can anybody recall any others I haven’t listed here? Is it possible that all God’s attributes can be expressed as “omnis”? ![](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
