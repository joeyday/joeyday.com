I just upgraded Janene’s and my blog to the latest version of \[WordPress\] using a slick bash script created by one of my buddies, [Aaron Toponce](http://www.pthree.org). If you’ve never upgraded WordPress before, I’d recommend doing it by hand at least once so you understand the process (instructions are [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress)), but if you’re looking for something to automagically upgrade your blog with minimal fuss, check out the script on Aaron’s blog: [WordPress Upgrade Script](http://www.pthree.org/2007/03/02/wordpress-upgrade-script/). Worked like a charm for both the blogs I used it on, and I’ll definitely continue using it in the future. Good work, Aaron! :syzygy:
