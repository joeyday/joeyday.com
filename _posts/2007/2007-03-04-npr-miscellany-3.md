I’ll come clean and say that Poker is one of my guilty pleasures. I’ve got a Texas Hold ‘Em game on my Treo and I usually stop to watch whenever I’m channel surfing and run across a high-stakes Poker tournament on TV. I’m also a modest fan of Jazz music, so I was entertained by a story I caught today on <cite>[Weekend Edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekend_Edition)</cite>. The story was about a new music collection that’s been released by Ricky Jay called <cite>[Ricky Jay Plays Poker](http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000HT2MB4/joeyday)</cite>. The collection includes Poker-related music down through the decades, a good portion of which is classic Jazz and Folk music. Snippets of the songs were played throughout the interview. I especially like the last song they played, “Dolan’s Poker Party” by Frank Crumit. Here’s the story: “[Hustler Ricky Jay Deals Poker Music, History](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7702392)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=WESUN&showDate=04-Mar-2007&segNum=19)).

Another interesting story I heard today, also on <cite>Weekend Edition</cite>, was about an Eagle Scout from Maryland who has earned all 122 merit badges the [Boy Scouts of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_scouts_of_america) has to offer. His last merit badge was bugling, which he says he saved until the end because he never was very musical. It’s interesting to hear how getting all these merit badges has positively affected his career choices and his understanding of the world around him. Here’s the story: “[Maryland Eagle Scout Earns All 122 Merit Badges](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7706158)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=WESUN&showDate=04-Mar-2007&segNum=7)).

A third and final story I found interesting today, once again on <cite>Weekend Edition</cite>, was about the [Scott’s Miracle-Gro](http://www.miraclegro.com/) company and a controversial policy they have against employing people who smoke cigarettes. The policy (among other changes) was initially proposed to cut health care costs. The story was done in two segments. Here’s the first one, where Scott’s VP of Corporate Communications, Jim King, answers questions about the policy: “[Miracle-Gro Faces Lawsuit over No-Smoking Policy](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7706152)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=WESUN&showDate=04-Mar-2007&segNum=5)); and here’s the second one, where they discuss in further detail a lawsuit over the policy that’s being brought against Scott’s by one of its employees: “[Former Miracle-Gro Employee Challenges Policy](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7706155)” ([listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=WESUN&showDate=04-Mar-2007&segNum=6)). :syzygy:
