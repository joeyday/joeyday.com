[![Start to Finish MS - MS Bike Tour '07](/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/starttofinishms.gif)](http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BIKE_UTU_homepage)

I’ll be riding my bike in the [Harmons MS Bike Tour](http://main.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BIKE_UTU_homepage) this year on June 23 in Cache Valley, Utah. Read on to find out how you can help me.

[Multiple sclerosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis) is a chronic, inflammatory disease that interrupts the flow of information from the brain to the body and, in severe cases, causes impaired mobility and disability. There is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis and more than 400,000 Americans live with this debilitating illness. This tour (and about a hundred more like it across the country) is a chance for the [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/) to raise awareness and funds, and it’s a great way for me to get in shape and have some fun this summer.

I’m posting this primarily to ask you—yes, you!—to sponsor me in this event. My goal is to raise $500 for MS research and programs. Your contribution is tax-deductible and will be used not only to fund research toward a cure in the future, but also for programs addressing the needs of people living with MS today. Here’s a breakdown of where your dollar goes:

Your contribution can, and will, make an immediate difference for everyone who must face the unpredictable nature of multiple sclerosis. Because of your help, each mile I ride in the MS Bike Tour becomes more powerful and brings us closer to a cure.

</div>However much you can give—great or small—will help. Thank you for your support!

I’d also like to invite you to join me on the tour. Feel free to \[contact me\] if you’d like to come along for the ride or if you have any questions.
