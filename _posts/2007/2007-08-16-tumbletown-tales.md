The wife and I were channel surfing the other day and stumbled across the strangest show we’ve ever seen. It’s actually not a whole show, per se, but rather a short segment of a children’s program called *TVOKids* developed for TVOntario Canadian public television. The segment, called *Tumbleweed Tales*, is meant to teach kids simple math concepts, but the funny thing is that it’s performed entirely by small rodents (with character dialog performed by the hosts of *TVOKids*).

It’s probably best I stop explaining and just let you watch. Let me know if you find it as entertaining as we did.
