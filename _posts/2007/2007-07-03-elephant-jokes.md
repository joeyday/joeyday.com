How do you catch a white elephant?</dt><dd>A. Go to a place where there are white elephants. Bring with you a muffin with raisins. Climb a tree. When the white elephant is close, drop the muffin with raisins in front of it. The white elephant will be happy and eat the muffin with raisins. White elephants like muffins with raisins. Repeat this procedure for five days in a row. After the fifth day, the white elephant will become accustomed to its daily muffin with raisins. The sixth day you climb the tree, bringing with you a muffin without raisins. Drop the muffin without raisins as usual. When the white elephant finds out that the muffin lacks rasins, he will darken with anger. It’s precisely at this moment when you catch him the same way you catch an ordinary gray elephant.</dd></dl>Feel free to post additional elephant jokes in the comments. Cheers!
