I hear a lot of interesting stories on [NPR](http://www.npr.org), so I’m going to start highlighting a few of them from time to time on my blog. Tonight I heard a couple great stories on <cite>[All Things Considered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Considered)</cite> that I’d like to share.

The first story is about a bizarre problem that’s killing commercial bees all over the U.S. called [Colony Collapse Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_Collapse_Disorder). This is a big deal because a lot of the crops we consume are pollinated by these bees. Here’s the story: “[Disease Hits Bees, and Vital Crops Suffer](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7388742)” ([Listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=ATC&showDate=13-Feb-2007&segNum=17)).

The second story is about one the best Iranian food chefs in Washington, D.C. The kicker is that he’s not even from Iran. Instead, he’s from El Salvador. He started as a bus boy in an Iranian restaurant and worked his way into the kitchen. Now he owns his own restaurant and flies all over the world to cook for special events. My favorite part of this story is the part about the deeply religious people who are shocked to find out that a Christian Latino had prepared their Islamic [Halal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal) dinner (they calm down when they learn he does everything by the book). Here’s the story: “[In D.C., Top Iranian Chef Hails From El Salvador](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7388748)” ([Listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/dmg/audioplayer.php?prgCode=ATC&showDate=13-Feb-2007&segNum=19)).
