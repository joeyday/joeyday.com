Here’s one of the first videos I uploaded to YouTube myself, a demonstration of why Simba is my favorite cat in the world.

*Update August 2, 2007: This video (along with all my videos) has been moved to [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/joeyday). I don’t like some of the new features YouTube released recently so I went looking for an alternative. Vimeo seems to have better privacy controls and I just like their interface a little better than YouTube’s.*
