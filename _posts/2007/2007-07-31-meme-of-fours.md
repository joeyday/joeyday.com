I was [tagged](http://www.janeneday.com/2007/07/30/another-meme/) for this by my lovely wife, so here goes:

#### Four jobs Iâ€™ve had

1. Pizza deliverer for [5 Buck Pizza](http://www.5buckpizza.com/)
2. Coffee and danish gopher ((This is a joke, actually. I canâ€™t recall getting anyone coffee or a danish once during the three months I was there. This was actually a very rewarding internship where I learned boatloads about what it means to work in full-time ministry.)) for the Youth Pastor at [Southeast Baptist Church](http://www.southeastbaptist.org)
3. Superhero ((This is an exaggeration, obviously, but not far from the truth. As an IT Service Desk Technician, I put out a lot of fires and generally save the day on a regular basis.)) for [Western Governors University](http://www.wgu.edu)
4. Evil junk mailer ((This oneâ€™s no joke. I maintained a Microsoft Access database full of leads (mostly homeowners gathered from public records) and printed, stuffed, and mailed several hundred mail merge letters per week to people on the list. It was a good paying high school job, but Iâ€™ll never do it again, I promise.)) for [Centex Home Equity](http://www.nationstarmtg.com/)

#### Four films I could watch over and over

1. [Stranger Than Fiction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/)
2. [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/)
3. [Lord of the Rings: Return of the King](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/)
4. A toss-up between [The Incredibles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/) and [Ratatouille](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/)

#### Four places Iâ€™ve lived

1. [San Antonio, Texas](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=san+antonio,+texas&ie=UTF8&z=10&iwloc=addr&om=1)
2. [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=oklahoma+city,+oklahoma&ie=UTF8&z=10&iwloc=addr&om=1)
3. [Louisville, Kentucky](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=louisville,+kentucky&ie=UTF8&z=11&iwloc=addr&om=1)
4. [Salt Lake City, Utah](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=salt+lake+city,+utah&ie=UTF8&z=11&iwloc=addr&om=1)

#### Four favorite TV shows

#### Four favorite foods

2. Small sweet pork salad at [Costa Vida Fresh Mexican Grill](http://www.costavida.net/)
3. Half Santa Fe salad at [Applebeeâ€™s](http://www.applebees.com/)
4. Sticky fingers dinner at [Wingerâ€™s Grill &amp; Bar](http://www.wingers.info/)

#### Four websites I visit daily ((There are many sites I visit daily, but to keep things interesting Iâ€™ve left out sites that pertain directly to work (since you canâ€™t log into most of them anyway) and sites that I created myself such as this blog, the [Homestar Runner Wiki](http://www.hrwiki.org), and [FellowSites](http://www.fellowsites.org).))

1. [Google](http://www.google.com), [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader), and [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)
2. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org)
3. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) â€” my private wishlist, consisting mostly of books, is an order of magnitude longer than anyoneâ€™s ever should be
4. [introPLAY](http://www.introplay.com) â€” I track all my bicycle rides here

#### Four places Iâ€™d rather be

1. At the movies
2. On my bicycle
3. Curled up with a good book on the couch at home
4. Curled up with my wife on the couch at home ðŸ˜‰

#### Four people Iâ€™m tagging
