One of my favorite music groups, [The Weepies](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weepies) (who I’ve [blogged about before](/2006/09/27/the-weepies)), is [auctioning](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=330194102317) a ’63 Fender Vibroverb Reissue amplifier ((The amplifier wasn’t really made in 1963, hence the word “reissue” in the model name. It was really made somewhere between 1990 and 1995 and is a replica of the classic ’63 model. It’s still a cool amp, though.)) they used to record their *Say I Am You* album and on the road during the subsequent North American concert tour. The cool thing is the proceeds from the auction will go to [Free Arts for Abused Children](http://www.freearts.org), a charity group that uses the arts to provide healing for abused and at risk kids.

And if this isn’t cool enough, they threw in a little bonus and announced they’ve recorded a new album! I’ve thoroughly enjoyed *[Say I Am You](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weepies/Say+I+Am+You)* and *[Happiness](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weepies/Happiness)*, and can’t wait to hear something new from these fantastic musicians. They haven’t divulged the album’s release date, yet. As far as I’m concerned it can’t come soon enough. ![End mark](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
