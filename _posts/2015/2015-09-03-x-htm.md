Curiously, ServiceNow’s [GlideDuration](http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Scoped_GlideDuration_API_Reference) object gives you a way to *set* the duration in milliseconds (i.e. passing in the millisecond value when constructing a new instance) but there’s no simple way to *get back* that duration expressed in milliseconds. You can get it back expressed in days, hours, minutes, and seconds in just about any format you might need, but not in total milliseconds. I recently had a use case for expressing a duration in total hours, where being able to get back a millisecond value would have been very convenient. But instead I had to get creative with string manipulation to convert the duration display value back into milliseconds. If you need to do this too, do yourself a favor and put it in a Script Include so it’s reusable.

Here’s my Script Include, which you are welcome to copy verbatim or use as inspiration for your own (at the very least, I recommend replacing “ACME” with your company’s name or initials, or just name it according to whatever convention you would normally follow at your organization):

{% highlight javascript %}
var ACMEDurationHelper = Class.create();  
ACMEDurationHelper.prototype = {  
	initialize: function() {  
	},

	// Accepts a GlideDuration object, passes back
	// total milliseconds of the duration.
	getTotalMS: function(dur) {
		var durVal = dur.getDurationValue();

		// Parse the duration value into days and time
		var durValArr = durVal.split(' ');
		var days = 0;
		if (durValArr.length == 2) {
			var days = parseInt(durValArr.shift(), 10);
		}
		var time = durValArr.shift();

		// Parse the time into hours, minutes, and seconds
		var timeArr = time.split(':');
		var hours = parseInt(timeArr[0], 10);
		var minutes = parseInt(timeArr[1], 10);
		var seconds = parseInt(timeArr[2], 10);

		// Calculate and return total milliseconds
		return days * 86400000
			 + hours * 3600000
			 + minutes * 60000
			 + seconds * 1000;
	},

	getTotalSecs: function(dur) {
		return this.getTotalMS(dur) / 1000;  
	},

	getTotalMins: function(dur) {
		return this.getTotalMS(dur) / 60000;
	},

	getTotalHrs: function(dur) {
		return this.getTotalMS(dur) / 3600000;
	},

	getTotalDays: function(dur) {
		return this.getTotalMS(dur) / 86400000;
	},

	type: 'ACMEDurationHelper'
};
