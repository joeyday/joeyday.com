One of the pastors of our church ([Jordan Valley Church](http://jordanvalleychurch.org/) in West Jordan, Utah) recently received and accepted a call to become the pastor at [Grace Church](http://graceutah.org) in Layton, Utah. Yesterday Pastor Tim preached at our church for the last time and the congregation fellowshipped afterward with a fried chicken and potluck meal to celebrate his ministry to us and give him a proper send off.

While we were eating, a microphone was passed around to give people a chance to say a little something about Pastor Tim. I didn’t volunteer then, but I want to take the opportunity here to collect the various tweets I’ve posted over the past couple years quoting things he’s said in his sermons or sharing pictures of him.

We love you Pastor Tim. If you’re half the blessing to Grace Church as you’ve been to us they’ll be blessed indeed. Godspeed in all your future endeavors, friend.{% include endmark.html %}
