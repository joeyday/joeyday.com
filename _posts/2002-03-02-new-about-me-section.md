I don’t have a lot of time to write today, but I just wanted to make people aware that I’ve created a new About Me page. It is now available from the menu at the left, or of course, from the link above.

So, yesterday was my first day at work. I loved it! I’m working with a lot of great people and the restaurant seems a lot better organized than Frontier Pies was. I’m excited to continue to learn my job responsibilities. I think this will be a wonderful job for me.{% include endmark.html %}
