[A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com) released a new article this week by author Stuart Robertson. The article details an [intriguing new form of the old-fashioned image map](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap/). He throws the image up as a background and then uses CSS to position the links over the top. Pretty clever, eh?

However, what I think is even more clever is the site he designed using the technique: [Blambot’s Dead Ends](http://www.visitdeadends.com). It’s a choose your own adventure book! I used to love those when I was a kid. I haven’t had a chance to read much of this one, but the site looks incredible. Who would’ve thought you could build a great looking page like this using standards compliant methods?
