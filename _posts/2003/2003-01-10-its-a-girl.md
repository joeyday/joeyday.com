Janene got a call from her friend Lisa tonight, and we made a trip out to the hospital to see her. Some of you reading the site may guess what is coming next. You see, Lisa _was_ pregnantâ€”emphasis on was. That's right, Mike and Lisa's daughter, Libby, was born on January 9, 2003. She weighed in at 6 lbs. 2 oz., and measured about 19 inches long. She has to be one of the most precious babies I've ever seen. Congratulations Mike and Lisa, and Happy Birthday Libby!{% include endmark.html %}
