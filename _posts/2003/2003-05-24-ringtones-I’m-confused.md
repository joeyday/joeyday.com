[Livewire: Ringtone Market More Than Just Hot Air?](https://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&storyID=2811407)

Apparently by 2005, sales will be somewhere around $400 millionâ€”for cellular phone ringtones?!? I guess some of the newest phones allow you to use ringtones that have mp3 quality, so the music industry is cashing in on royalties for short clips of popular songs. However, one of the highest selling ringtones actually sounds like a fart. Maybe I'm just jealous because I can't download ringtones to my phone, but I really think this whole industry is absolutely ridiculous.

Listen to what Verizon had to say in defense of not allowing their customers to download from third party developers: "There have been many companies who have attempted to provide free downloads and we block our customers technologically from downloading them onto their devices because at that point we cannot protect against viruses or anything that would harm their services or phones." What would they call that virus? The ringworm? C'mon. Who's out there writing viruses for cell-phones? You're just in it for the money, Verizon. Get over it.{% include endmark.html %}
