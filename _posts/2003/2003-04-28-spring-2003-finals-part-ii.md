My second final today was not really a comprehensive final. It was simply the fourth exam in my Psychology class. It only covered information we've learned since the last exam, and followed the same format of the first three exams: 40 multiple choice questions in a one hour time limit. There was a review a few days ago, so I went in to this test feeling very well prepared. There were really only one or two questions I wasn't entirely confident about, so I think I'll get a pretty good grade. Cross your fingers for me, okay?{% include endmark.html %}
