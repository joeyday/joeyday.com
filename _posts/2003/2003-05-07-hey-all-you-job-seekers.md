_[Fixapicture.com](http://fixapicture.com/)_ has been "fully operational" for a couple months. We've had several inquiries and 1 customer who has shelled out over $100 on just two pictures, and she's about ready to pay another $150. That's not a lot, but we've NEVER advertised.

The customer isn't even a relativeâ€”she lives in Wisconsin.

Our largest competitor on the web pays to advertise. Paying must be worth it to them; advertising must generate customers.

My point is...

## Market

My point is there IS a market out there for our photo-editing service. People want their pictures fixed, restored, and reprinted. People want to add missing people to their family gatherings, and they want to fix their own bad facial expressions. They don't want to pay a lot for Photoshop, and they don't know how to edit pictures on their own.
People just need to know about us, but I don't know how to market the business alone. I need your help.

## Job Description

Until December 2003, __I will give you HALF of any revenue _[Fixapicture.com](http://fixapicture.com/)_ generates from customers you bring in.__

Every one of you can spend just a little time each day, each week, or each month marketing _[Fixapicture.com](http://fixapicture.com/)_. You don't have to drop out of school (like I did for a semester), and you don't have to worry whether the business you are working for will be there tomorrow; this business costs next to nothing to run--it's not going to fold.

__Set your own hours and do your job however you want!__ You can find ways to advertise online, in the media, or around town. You can talk to photography studios about outsourcing their photo editing to us. You can put posters at photo-developing places or hand them out at wedding/family gatherings (I've got posters you can have).

_[Fixapicture.com](http://fixapicture.com/)_ even has a small advertising budget. If you have a great idea for advertising but no money to spend, talk to me about it.

If a customer says they responded to an ad you organized, __you get half of what they pay.__

## Conclusion

I really believe this company has potential. There's a market out there. There's a working company in here. Come get in on the ground floor, and help us bring the two together!
