Today is my parents' wedding anniversary. They've been married for 27 years as of today. I would like to take this moment to say, "Happy Anniversary!"

Mom and Dad: I just want to say thank you for the wonderful 24 years in which I have been a part of your family. You guys have always been such a good example for me of a couple committed to one another, and this has made you two of the best parents anyone could hope to have. I love you both so much!{% include endmark.html %}

[Incidentally, today is also Janene's parents' anniversary. Happy Anniversary to you guys too!]
