[SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com) ran an article today that mentions wikis. The article is about hypertext — what it is, why it was invented, and how understanding it can help you make better webpages.

Here’s the article: “[Caffeinate Your Hypertext](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1226)“.

The article explains (very matter-of-factly) that hypertext and HTML aren’t the same thing. Hypertext is simply a text document that is — as the article puts it — caffeinated. HTML, on the other hand, is a standardized language used in creating hypertext.

I rather enjoyed reading the article, since it introduces several sites that are using hypertext in new and innovative ways. It lists the [WikiWikiWeb](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki) among many others.
