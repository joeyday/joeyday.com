The UPC is manning a booth at freshman orientations throughout the month. We are trying to collect names and email addresses for people who are interested in joining our committees. We're also starting a mailing list for event announcements. We have a display that we set up with pictures of the events and information about the Union and the UPC, and we've been handing out CDs, candy, and UPC pens.

Since it was so windy today, I spent half the time holding our display so it wouldn't fly away. I also got a free lunch out of the deal, and it tasted alright considering the sandwich was stale. I half expected the freshmen to be more annoying than they were, but they actually seemed like an alright bunch. I couldn't help but think back to my freshmen orientation and remember how lost I was. Every one of them looked quite overwhelmed with new information.

I'm going to be doing these orientation meetings every Tuesday and Thursday for the next month, so it should be interesting.{% include endmark.html %}
