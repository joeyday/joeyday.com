[Interesting article](https://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/americas/04/11/cuba.execution/index.html)

I was a little shocked when I first read this. It is just so different from how similar situations are handled in the US.

I don’t really know what exactly had gone on in the past with these guys (the hijackers). I just feel that in cases like this, or take the US soldier that killed two other soldiers a few weeks ago, that swift punishment is justified. When your country is at war (well, I guess Cuba isn’t really at war right now), but when the world is at war you can’t take things lightly.

Compared to my close friends (shi and joey) I am usually a little bit closer to the center (or even left of center sometimes) on political issues. However, in cases like these I think what happened deserved to happen. None of this “sit in a jail cell waiting for a trial in three years, only to be sentanced to 17 years in prison. After 5 years get released because no one remembers, or cares, about what you did.” Crap like that can’t be tolerated. Enough ranting.... I need sleep. 😊
