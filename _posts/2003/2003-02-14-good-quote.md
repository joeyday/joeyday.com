I found this quote and I thought it was very interesting. What do you think?

> Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be.<br />â€” Thomas A. Kempis

Here's the website I found it on... They have some good quotes on there.<br />
