ok... I really have no idea what to say about this...

[click me](https://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/31/sprj.irq.arnett/index.html)

I would especially like to draw attention to this paragraph.

> During the Iraqi TV interview, Arnett said, “I’d like to say from the beginning that [for] the 12 years I’ve been coming here, I’ve met unfailing courtesy and cooperation, courtesy from your people and cooperation from the Ministry of Information.”

actually... i do know what to say. If they are so nice over there... don’t bother coming back.
