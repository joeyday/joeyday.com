That's right. The same horse that took the Kentucky Derby had an excellent win at the Preakness Stakes, the second jewel in the Triple Crown. That means if he wins the Belmont Stakes on June 7, 2003, he becomes the first Triple Crown winning horse since 1978, and the first New York bred horse ever to capture a Triple Crown.

I didn't see the Preakness (I wasn't really interested to tell you the truth), but I was able to find a [video](http://msnbc.com/news/914936.asp?0sl=-23) on MSNBC.com. June 7 just happens to be the two year anniversary of mine and Janene's first date, so I plan to be out somewhere having fun, but you can be sure I'll be recording the Belmont! Go Funny Cide!

If you'd like more info, there were a number of articles on Reuters.com.
