My old domain name officially expires today. If for some strange reason you are still using Qangaroo.com to get here, or are still emailing me using a Qangaroo.com email address, it isn’t going to work anymore. From now on you’ll have to use JoeyDay.com.

A lot of my Internet account names used to be Qangaroo. Now I’m in the process of switching them over to variants of my name. If you have me on your Instant Messenger program, you should only send messages to my new identity and delete the old one (I won’t be using the old ones anyway so you shouldn’t ever see them online). If you are interested in adding me to your IM list, email me your contact info, and I’ll reply with mine (assuming I know who you are). Those of you who are already on my list should have received the new address by now through your IM program.
