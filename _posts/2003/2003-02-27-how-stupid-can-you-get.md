title:  How Stupid Can You Get?

I saw a flyer on campus today that really made me angry. An organization called [The National Youth & Student Peace Coalition](http://www.nyspc.net) is advocating a college strike in order to convince the Bush administration not to go to war with Iraq. They are askingâ€”nay, urgently encouragingâ€”students to sluff all of their classes on March 5, 2003.

Now, most people reading this site already know that I stand fully behind President Bush on the decision to get Saddam out of Iraq. However, even if I was against war in Iraq, I could certainly think up a better protest strategy than skipping a day of class. What are they thinking? "Gee, let's show Mr. President how serious we are by depriving ourselves of a college education." How much is it really going to affect the government if you skip a few classes? Isn't it only going to hurt yourself?

It just really ticks me off how stupid some people can be. ðŸ˜– {% include endmark.html %}
