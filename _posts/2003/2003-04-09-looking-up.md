If you can believe it, today is the first time in a long time that I actually attended all three of my classes at the U. I still feel bad that I was ten minutes late to the first one, but all in all this is a drastic improvement.

I also signed up to participate in two psychology experiments. One on emotions and one on personality. That will bring my credit up to 3.5 hours. I’m required to do at least 3 hours for the class, but I can get extra credit for up to 3 additional hours. I plan to do as many additional hours as possible since I missed an exam last month (oops :eek).

I’m taking Janene out this evening for our 22 month anniversary (1 5/6 years). It was actually on Monday, but tonight was the best night for us to get out. We’re planning to go to Cafe Rio. We went there a few weeks ago and I had a grilled steak burrito. It was honestly the best burrito I’ve ever had in my life. If you’ve never been to Cafe Rio, I highly recommend it. After dinner we’re gonna go bowling. I’m really looking forward to spending a fun evening with my sweetheart.{% include endmark.html %}
