I just spoke with Mondi Basmenji, this year's Union Programming Council Board Chair. I've been chosen to be next year's Technology Chair! This doesn't come as much of a surprise, since I was about the only person to apply, but I'm glad to have the selection process out of the way.

The transition will happen April 18 and 19, and I should be receiving an email any day now with more information about how that's all going to work. I've already asked Stuart to serve on my commitee, and I'd like to extend an invitation to any other U of U students with any kind of web-design experience (PHP, CGI, and Flash are a plus, but certainly not necessary). If anyone reading this wants to join, or knows someone who may be interested, please [contact me](mailto:utech@joeyday.com) for more information.

I also want to thank all of my friends and family who have supported me either directly, or through other means. I really appreciate everyone's help proofreading my application and I'm grateful for your all of your thoughts and prayers on my behalf. I'm really looking forward to serving the University in this new position.{% include endmark.html %}
