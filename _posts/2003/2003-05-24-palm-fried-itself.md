My Palm died a few days ago. It reset itself two or three times in the space of about ten minutes. It was extremely inconvenient, since I was in the middle of filling out a job application at the time. ðŸ˜§

After it reset itself, it wouldn't come back on, so I was trying to use the reset pin on the back to bring it up. At that point the screen started flickering wildly until it finally went entirely white. It has remained in that state for three days, although I'm pretty sure that the battery must be dead by nowâ€”the auto-off feature isn't even working!

I have a 2 year extended warranty from Office Max, and I've used it a couple of times to have it replaced, but since Office Max no longer carries the model I have, they instructed me to call the 1-800 number listed in the warranty. They're going to send out a prepaid shipping label so I can send it in for repairs. If they can't repair it they'll send me a check for the full price.

If anybody out there is thinking of buying a Palm, I would definitely recommend getting some kind of warranty. It has saved my butt enough times that I can safely say those were some of the best 40 bucks I've ever spent.{% include endmark.html %}
