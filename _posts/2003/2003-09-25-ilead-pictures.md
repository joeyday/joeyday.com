I've had these pictures up for a while but never made an official announcement about them. They've actually been unavailable over the last few weeks because of all the server switching and site rebuilding.

To see my pictures from I-LEAD, visit [ilead.joeyday.com](http://ilead.joeyday.com/).

I had so much fun at I-LEAD and I just want to give a shout out to all my new friends. I don't think I'll ever forget the experiences I had in Indiana that week. Thanks everyone!{% include endmark.html %}

[As of October 8, 2003, [my I-LEAD pictures](http://firstedition.joeyday.com/images/ilead) have been moved so that the address above can be used for the I-LEAD 2003 Participants Forum.]
