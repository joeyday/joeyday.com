In case you haven’t noticed yet, Stu’s got a nice [forum](http://forum.cool-stu.com) set up. While he’s fiddling with MT and his new forum, I’m trying hard to figure out how to install a Wiki on my site.

Some of you may be asking yourselves, “What the heck is a Wiki?” Well, a wiki is a site where *anyone* can edit *any* page at *any* time. Now before you start asking all the obvious questions, let me direct your attention to a few pages that might help you understand what I’m talking about.

Check out [WhyWikiWorks](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks) and [WikiGettingStartedFaq](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiGettingStartedFaq).

One very successful wiki is the [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), a free, open encyclopedia. They have over 160,000 entries and it reads just like any other good encyclopedia. I would probably trust it to provide information for my next research paper, even though it’s been written and revised entirely by ordinary web-surfers!

Anyway, there are a ton of [WikiEngines](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines) out there, but I think I found the one I want to use. It’s called [WikkiTikkiTavi](http://tavi.sourceforge.net). It uses PHP and MySQL, and (supposedly) every page validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict. You can also specify where it should look for the stylesheet, which means I can customize the layout of the page to my heart’s content.

Unfortunately, installing ‘Tavi requires shell access, which I don’t have. Actually, I’ve read through the [installation directions](http://tavi.sourceforge.net/TaviInstructions) about five times, and I think I’ve found ways around almost all of the command line stuff. I probably won’t install it for a couple of days (because I know it will be a big project), but I think I’ve got a rough plan for how I’m going to do it. Wish me luck!
