Every weekend, Janene and I visit with Granny (Janene's mother's mother). Granny has some health issues (she's been using oxygen on and off for the past several weeks) and she doesn't have many visitors, so it is a good time to keep her company and dispell the loneliness that creeps its way in during the week. Granny always has a jigsaw puzzle on hand, and we have probably helped her put together three or four of them (most over 700 pieces, and one that had 1000). Jigsaw puzzling has sortof become our weekend tradition.

All that changed last night. Janene had never seen _Princess Bride_, so I decided it would be fun if we watched it with Granny. We took the movie over there and had pizza and soft drinksâ€”sortof a little pizza party. After _Princess Bride_ Granny suggested we pop in _The King and I_. Stuart and Shilo recently invited Janene and me to see the musical live at Hale Center Theatre. We both thought it would be interesting to see the video, so we went ahead and watched the first half. As it was playing, I thought about how fun it would be to watch all the classic movies: _The Sound of Music_, _The Music Man_, _Fiddler on the Roof_, _Gone with the Wind_, etc. When I suggested that to Granny, she seemed delighted.

It's fun to see her get excited about all of that. She couldn't stop commenting during _The King and I_. She really was familiar with the story and reminisced about how much cleaner movies were back then. I've always looked forward to our weekends with Granny, but even more now that we've started a new tradition.{% include endmark.html %}
