ContentWatch (the company I work for) just hired a new business manager who has decided to whip the place into shape in terms of productivity. My manager sent out the following email a few days ago:

bq.. Team,

Some of you may be aware that people and responsibilities have been changing lately. Prior to the formal announcement, I just wanted you to know that &lt;Name Removed&gt; has taken over the day to day management of ContentWatch and is building a new team with many existing people and some new people. The goal is to be the best in the Internet Protection Market which includes productivity of employees.

&lt;Name Removed&gt; has asked everyone to practice what we preach. To that end please make sure you are using our products on your machines, refrain from playing games on your computer, do not use instant messenger and use the Internet wisely. Non-company related searches and sites on the Internet should just be during your breaks.

Thanks….

&lt;Name Removed&gt;  
ContentWatch Inc.  
Customer Support Manager  
1-800-485-4008

p. I’m not excited about losing Instant Messaging, but I’m willing to sacrifice that in the name of productivity. If I’m completely honest with myself I have to admit that IM has been a distraction at times and kept me from answering as many emails as I could have.

Anyway, the major reason I’ve posted this is so that my friends will know why I’m not online during the day anymore. I’m not trying to ignore anybody, but orders are orders.

In related news, I just found out today that the company offices are being relocated. The new location is closer to the University (of course, just about anywhere is closer than Bluffdale :)), so it should save me quite a bit of gas. The move will take place the first week in December.
