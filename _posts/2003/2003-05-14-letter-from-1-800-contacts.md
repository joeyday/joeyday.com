title:	Letter From 1-800 CONTACTS

I walked in the house this afternoon and checked the counter for my mail, and there was a letter from 1-800 CONTACTS. I figure it's pretty customary for a company to call you if they want to hire you and send you a letter if not, so right away I prepared myself for the worst. I've included a copy of the letter below. Please note: My own commentary is in brackets throughout the letter. ðŸ˜Š

> Dear Joseph,
>
> Thank you for your interest in the Customer Service position at 1-800 CONTACTS, Inc. We are excited about the large number of people who would like to work with us [because it means you can pick all the really great people and drop the losers like me, right?].
>
> After consideration of all resumes, applicants, and interviewees [is that even a word?] we have arrived at a hiring decision. We try to choose those who best "fit" the job [what are you saying, that I'm fat?] based on experience, skills, etc. At this time, regretfully, we are not able to offer you a position. However, we will keep your resume on file for future openings that match your qualifications [you only said that to be nice].
>
> 1-800 CONTACTS is a fast-growing company, and we look forward to expanding our limits [sounds like you have a great company, but if you're still trying to make me feel better, it's not working anymore]. Thank you for taking the time to apply for employment with 1-800 CONTACTS [you're probably only grateful because you're going to sell all of my personal information to the highest bidder] and best wishes for success in your job search.

> Sincerely,

I wish I could say I'm angry, but if I was being proactive I would have a job by now. I'm starting to feel really frustrated with the situation, because I know I could get a great job, but what if I'm being too picky? Should I just apply at four thousand places and take the first one that calls me back? Is the job market such that hand picking a job is just not possible?{% include endmark.html %}
