Eason Jordan, chief news executive at CNN, writes in today’s New York Times:

“Over the last dozen years I made 13 trips to Baghdad to lobby the government to keep CNN’s Baghdad bureau open and to arrange interviews with Iraqi leaders. Each time I visited, I became more distressed by what I saw and heard — awful things that could not be reported because doing so would have jeopardized the lives of Iraqis, particularly those on our Baghdad staff. ...

“The secret police terrorized Iraqis working for international press services who were courageous enough to try to provide accurate reporting. Some vanished, never to be heard from again. Others disappeared and then surfaced later with whispered tales of being hauled off and tortured in unimaginable ways. ...

“I came to know several Iraqi officials well enough that they confided in me that Saddam Hussein was a maniac who had to be removed. One Foreign Ministry officer told me of a colleague who, finding out his brother had been executed by the regime, was forced, as a test of loyalty, to write a letter of congratulations on the act to Saddam Hussein. An aide to Uday once told me why he had no front teeth: henchmen had ripped them out with pliers and told him never to wear dentures, so he would always remember the price to be paid for upsetting his boss. ...

“Then there were the events that were not unreported but that nonetheless still haunt me. A 31-year-old Kuwaiti woman, Asrar Qabandi, was captured by Iraqi secret police occupying her country in 1990 for ’crimes,’ one of which included speaking with CNN on the phone. They beat her daily for two months, forcing her father to watch. In January 1991, on the eve of the American-led offensive, they smashed her skull and tore her body apart limb by limb. A plastic bag containing her body parts was left on the doorstep of her family’s home.

“I felt awful having these stories bottled up inside me. Now that Saddam Hussein’s regime is gone, I suspect we will hear many, many more gut-wrenching tales from Iraqis about the decades of torment. At last, these stories can be told freely.”

My (Keith’s) comment:

They kept this information from the world, just to keep a presence in Iraq. I have to ask, can we believe any of the CNN news coming out of countries that are lead by brutal regimes? I doubt it. How will we know if they are brutal or not if the media does not have the courage to report it?

I am sick and tired of journalists who are trying to become heroes by finding fault with America (they do it because they have the freedom to), and then ignore horrific circumstances in other countries in order to keep a presence there (money grubbers!). They expose all the dirty laundry about truly free countries (because they have been given that privilege by courageous men who fought and died for it), but they have NO courage when it comes to exposing the brutal tactics of truly evil governments. If they had any integrity or courage, CNN would have pulled all their people out of Iraq years ago and then exposed Saddam’s evil regime for what it was!

What else are they keeping from us?

Shame on CNN.
