A friend at work sent this to me. It is a Honda Accord commercial that has been airing in Europe for a little while now.

Before you watch it you should be aware that no computer generated graphics or digital effects were utilized to create the finished product. What you are seeing is what really happened. To obtain all of the parts, engineers dissassembled two of the only six handmade Honda Accords in the world. The commercial required 606 takes before everything worked as planned.

You may need to watch it two or three times to figure out what is going on in a few of the situations. Note that the new Accord features windshield wipers that activate automatically when water is present on the windshield. That was one of the only parts that really confused me the first time.

There have been several articles published about the commercial. I’ve listed a few of them below:
