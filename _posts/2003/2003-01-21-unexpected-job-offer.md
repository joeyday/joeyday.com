title:  Unexpected Job Offer

Janene recently received an unexpected job offer. For those who don't know, Janene works in a medical billing office. By April 2003 all medical facilities are required to be compliant with a set of government privacy regulations known as HIPAA. Janene had a doctor appointment last week. While she was there she couldn't help but notice that the clinic was not compliant yet. After the physical, when her doctor asked if she had any questions, she explained to him some of her concerns. She wasn't at all expecting what happened next. The doctor took her down the hall to speak with the clinic administrator!

The administrator listened carefully as Janene explained her background in medical billing, along with the things she had seen in his office and why she was concerned. He expressed that he was also concerned, and needed someone to help him train his staff. He offered Janene a job making four dollars an hour more than her current job. She really only knows the billing side of HIPAA, and would have to do a lot of studying before she can start training people. The administrator seemed to understand this, and has already offered to set up a desk and a computer in the basement of the clinic so she can do her research. He also said he'd like to keep her on as a receptionist after April.

Janene hasn't really decided yet whether she'll take the job. I think her biggest concern is just the stress involved. She's agreed to take a week and study some of the material the clinic has given her just to test the water a bit. After the first week she'll have a little better idea of whether or not she can handle the position.

I want to ask everyone to please pray for Janene. She already feels like God may be working in the situation simply because it was so unexpected, but (from what I understand) the clinic administrator seems to cut corners occasionally in his business practices, so Janene's a little worried about working with him. Please pray that Janene can know what God would have her do, and that she can accept His will and do her best to see it through.{% include endmark.html %}
