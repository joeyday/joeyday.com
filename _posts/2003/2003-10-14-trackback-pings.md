You may have noticed over the past week that I added the trackback ping URI to some of the newest entries. It wouldn’t have really done you much good to ping those though, because I didn’t have anything working yet. Now I’ve actually taken the time to implement trackback pings. They should be fully operational (I hope).

I won’t know for sure until I ping this entry from my test blog. If it’s working, you should see a trackback ping below.
