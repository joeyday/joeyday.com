According to an article in the Trib today, the ACLU is seeing an increase in its membership. I don't have much experience with the ACLU, but I remember when the LDS seminary building at my high school burned down they threw some major hissy fits during the whole rebuilding process. I guess they were upset that it was being built a couple feet too close to the building or something.

Here's a link to the article: [War on Terror Boosts ACLU Membership](http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Feb/02192003/nation_w/30870.asp)

I like John Eastman's comments toward the end of the article. I agree that we should do something to fight against discrimination, but it sure seems to me like the ACLU does a lot of discriminating in the name of non-discrimination.{% include endmark.html %}
