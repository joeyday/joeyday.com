[A New Religion](http://www.dailyutahchronicle.com/news/408798.html)

These people have started a club which they jokingly (at least I hope they are joking) call a religion. They "worship" the Dance Dance Revolution machine in the University Student Union. I can't believe the outrageous amounts of money some of them claim they've spent on this stupid machine! They are probably all in excellent cardiovascular condition, but other than that I can't see why anyone would want to waste so much time and money.{% include endmark.html %}
