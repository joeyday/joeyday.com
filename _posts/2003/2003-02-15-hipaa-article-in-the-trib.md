I found this article in the Trib today. We will probably see more articles like this as April approaches. It's not exactly what I would write about HIPAA and what's coming, but I guess it will give you a little insight to what I'm working on with my new job (and what many other hospitals and clinics have to look forward to ðŸ˜Š).

[Strict Patient Privacy Rules to Take Effect](http://www.sltrib.com/2003/feb/02152003/nation_w/29824.asp)

I will be attending my first board meeting at the clinic on Wednesday. I don't really know what to thinkâ€”mostly because I've never had to stand in front of a group of doctors and tell them what to do. Ahh! ðŸ˜³

I'll keep you posted.
