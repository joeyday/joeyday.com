A few minutes ago I was looking at my GuestMap and thinking about all the tacks that used to be there. The reason they are not there anymore is because my free GuestMap provider deleted entries after so many days. ðŸ˜Ÿ

So I went looking and found a new free GuestMap site. This one has a limit of 100 posts (as opposed to 40 on the old one) and as far as I can tell it won't delete any tacks. ðŸ˜€

My main point in writing this entry is to encourage everyone who signed before to please [Tack the GuestMap](http://pub40.bravenet.com/guestmap/show.php?usernum=3374218698&lightmap=0&icons=0&&entrylist=0&zoom=0&welcome=1) again. Thanks!{% include endmark.html %}
