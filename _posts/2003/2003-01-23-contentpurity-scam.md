Want to see something really interesting? Compare my company's website, [ContentWatch](http://www.qksrv.net/click-1180654-5810729), to this company's website: [ContentPurity](http://www.contentpurity.com). I've configured the links to open in separate windows so you can open them both at the same time.

Someone from our office stumbled across this other site last night. Apparently the guys running "ContentPurity" used to be part of our affiliate program. They've ripped off all of our stuff, right down to the product descriptions! Originally, even their product names were the same as ours, but someone from our office contacted them this morning and since then they've changed a lot of stuff on their site. They've also blocked access to their website from anywhere in our office (as if they think we won't notice them anymore). I don't know how they did that, but now from inside the office we get a "403 Forbidden" Error.

Everything on the ContentWatch website is protected by copyrights and trademarks, and we've gone through the proper legal channels to get that done. It will be interesting to see if the owners of ContentWatch decide to sue.{% include endmark.html %}
