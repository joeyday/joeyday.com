I found a good quote today from John Adams, second President of the United States:

> It must be felt that there is no national security but in the nation's humble acknowledged dependence upon God and His overruling providence.

I really think this has never been more true than now. It is extremely important that we trust our nation's leaders and the soldiers who are fighting for us in the Middle East, but it is infinitely more important that we look to God to uphold our freedoms against those who would destroy them. According to Isaiah 63:1â€“2, He is "mighty to save", and He will deliver our troops from harm if we turn to Him in humble prayer.{% include endmark.html %}
