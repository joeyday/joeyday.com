Today was the first day of Spring Semester 2003. I'm taking Calculus III, General Psychology, World Religions, and Symphonic Band. I don't know yet which of the first three will be the most difficult. My professors appear to be quite knowledgable and able to teach well. I think my World Religions teacher is from the Middle East. He has a noticable accent, but I was able to understand him okay. Psychology might be weird since there are five different professors that will be teaching throughout the semester as the various aspects of Psychology are presented.

What really surprised me is that (with the exception of Calculus, where we will be doing weekly WebWorks assignments) the grades in each class are based entirely off of three or four exams. In fact, in my Psychology class they'll even drop the lowest one out of the four. This could be very good or very bad depending on how I choose to handle myself over the next four months, but I'm hoping that I will do well.

This was probably the first day of school for many of you who read the site, and if not, school has already started or will start soon. I want to wish everyone well this semester. Know that I'm hanging in there with you and praying for you all to do well.{% include endmark.html %}
