The University has started a pilot program where they’re giving away copies of the Salt Lake Tribune, the Deseret News, and USA Today. If they feel students will use the papers, they’ll add five bucks to student fees next year and make the free (well, sortof free) papers permanent.

Anyway, I grabbed a copy of the Trib today and read a very interesting article while I was riding Trax home.

Here it is: “[Iraqis trade in money for Saddam-free bills](http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Oct/10162003/nation_w/102344.asp)“.

Apparently their new bills are roughly the same size as monopoly money. That’s weird, but I guess the people are just happy Saddam’s face has been taken off the currency for good. The article didn’t mention it, but I wonder if the money has anyone else’s faces on it, and if so, who?
