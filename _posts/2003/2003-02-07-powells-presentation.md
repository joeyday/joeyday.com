Colin Powell gave a presentation to the U.N. on Wednesday providing U.S. Intelligence evidence that Iraq is still harboring weapons. You can read the story [here](http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=2178158) as provided by Reuters News.

Most of the articles I've read don't seem to go into much detail as to the actual evidence presented, but I tend to believe the U.S. government must have some pretty convincing stuff on Iraq or President Bush wouldn't be making such a big stink about it. I personally wonder if Bush isn't going a little bit overboard with the whole issue, but I definately wouldn't want to let World War III happen and have U.S. Intelligence come out and say "I told you so" to the rest of the world.

I think a lot of people are skeptical to the point where they want more time to find out if Iraq really is harboring these weapons. However, the longer we let this go and the more we "trust" Iraq, the closer we are coming to what could be really catastrophic. The facts clearly show that Saddam isn't exactly cooperating. If he doesn't have these weapons, he needs to realize that his lack of cooperation is really making him look bad to the rest of the world. He needs to step up or he'll be taken out of office faster than he realizes.{% include endmark.html %}
