Okay, I think I've been able to fix the errors. Turns out my hosting provider installed an upgrade for PHP, and the latest version follows a slightly different syntax for server-side includes. Suffice it to say, it's fixed.

If you do find any errors on the site, please let me know. Thanks!{% include endmark.html %}
