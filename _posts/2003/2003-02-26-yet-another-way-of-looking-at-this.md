There were two interesting articles in the [Daily Universe](http://newsnet.byu.edu/) (BYU Newspaper) today about refugee Iraqis living in Salt Lake. I'm not sure when the articles will be available online, but I will summarize.

The three Iraqis love their homeland and miss their families; they want to go home. However, they know they can't return until Saddam Hussein is gone.

They say Saddam's government taught them to hate Americans. Now that they have lived here since the gulf war, however, their opinions have changed.

Although they don't like war, especially in their own country, they know war must happen and people must die to remove Saddam. Their hopes of returning home lie in US military action.
