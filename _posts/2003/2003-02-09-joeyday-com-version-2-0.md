Welcome to the next generation of JoeyDay.com. Some of you may have noticed a slight absence of recent journal entries lately (although no one complained, so I'm not sure why I mention it). That's because I've discovered a new way of managing my site. It's called Movable Type, and it's taken me a few weeks to figure out how to get it working.

I've switch hosting providers. The site is now hosted by a company called [Hosting Matters](http://www.hostmatters.com). They are giving me support for PHP, CGI, SSI, and mySQL, plus a myriad of other very handy features. I also have 40 free email addresses now, so if anyone needs a POP3 email account, let me know.

Anyway, Movable Type supports multiple authors, so I've given Janene a login to the site. Hopefully she will post from time to time to give you some idea of what she's up to. Movable Type also provides a comment feature, so now anyone can reply to entries with a comment. The system has a lot of really neat archiving features, and it's all done automatically, so I'll no longer have to worry about hard coding all of my entries. What I like most about it is that it allows me complete control over what the templates look like, so as you can see the look of the site has remained almost entirely intact. In fact, the only layout changes I've made stem from the fact that I've moved away from using frames on my site. I'm now using a PHP include to get the same menu to appear on all the pages.

So hopefully I'll start posting often again. Let me know what you think about the new system, and keep checking back from time to time as I continue to add new stuff.{% include endmark.html %}
