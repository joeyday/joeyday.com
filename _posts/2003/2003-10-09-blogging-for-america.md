Guess what everyone? Georgie Bush has a blog site! You can [view it here](http://georgewbush.com/blog/).

No commenting allowed on that blog though. Darn! If you so desire to do so (or to read other peopleâ€™s responses on this whacked out creation) [go here](http://blog.deanforamerica.com/archives/001785.html).
