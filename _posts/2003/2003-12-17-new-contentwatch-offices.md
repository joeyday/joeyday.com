I moved all my stuff down to the new office today. I’ve been doing a lot of manual labor lately putting together cubicles and hauling heavy desks and computer equipment around. The new office is a bit shabbier than the old (try to imagine green carpet and cubicles with white hardware and pink fabric), but it’s far more spacious. My new cubicle has four walls that I can’t see over when I’m sitting down. I consider that a definite step up from two waist high walls and open space behind me.

The new office is at about 21st South and Redwood Rd., so it’s more convenient on days when I have both work and school. However, it’s actually farther away from my house, which makes it less convenient on days when I don’t have school (e.g. all of next semester). You win some, you lose some.
