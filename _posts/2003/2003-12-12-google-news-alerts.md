I absolutely love [Google News](http://news.google.com). It brings together articles from over 4,500 different news sites, and you can search for news on any topic you happen to be interested in.

One of the greatest features they’ve added to the system is [News Alerts](http://www.google.com/newsalerts). You can specify search terms and an email address, and you’ll receive news about your search terms as often as you specify. I’ve set up a few different ones, for instance: “mozilla firebird”, “university of utah”, “contentwatch”, and “southern baptist”. I love being able to read current news about things I am interested in, rather than having to wade through a bunch of news I don’t care to read.
