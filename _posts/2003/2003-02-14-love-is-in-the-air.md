I want to take a second to wish everyone (especially my lovely sweetheart, Janene) a very happy Valentine's Day!

Janene: What can I say that I haven't already said? You are the love of my life. You complete me. I don't know what I would do without you in my life. I think about those big blue eyes of yours and I can't help but wonder why I am so lucky. What did I do to deserve your love and companionship?

Thank you for being everything I've ever dreamed of and more. Thank you for spending time with me, for talking to me, for showing me that you care about me. Thank you for loving me despite my imperfections, my extremely deficient bank account, my annoying habits. Thank you for supporting me through my trials, my failures, my triumphs. Thank you for being there for me when I need you most. Thank you for you. Thank God for you.

I love you! ❤️{% include endmark.html %}
