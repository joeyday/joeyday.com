It’s official. The blog formerly known as <q>The Forum</q> has been combined with the journal formerly known as <q>JoeyDay.com</q>. What this means is that anyone who previously had power to post on The Forum can now post on my main blog (whatever I decide to call it).

I will probably continue posting journal type stuff here, but not as often, as I’ll probably concentrate more on news/blog type stuff. I will refer to this as a blog from now on, even though it will contain some journal content. I don’t anticipate that anyone will have problems with that.

I’m pretty excited about this new layout. I’ve been coding the site using Dreamweaver MX 2004 (what a slick program!) and I’m writing it completely in valid XHTML. Some pages are Strict and others are Transitional (because of some JavaScript stuff I can’t figure out) but I haven’t used a single table yet. The site sure looks crappy in anything other than the latest browsers, but that’s okay. I’m not making any money off this, so I couldn’t care less how it looks for people using old browsers. If you are using Netscape 4.7 (or some similarly ancient browser), please join the rest of us in the 21st century! I recommend [Mozilla Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org) (latest version is 0.6.1), but [Internet Explorer 6.0](http://www.microsoft.com/ie) isn’t too bad of a browser.

Anyway, if anyone is interested in learning XHTML, I can show you some great tutorials. It really isn’t as hard as you think it would be to learn. Taking full advantage of cascading style sheets makes rebuilding a layout so much easier. It’s really incredible.
