If you’re in to web design, but have never read any articles over at [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com), I highly recommend that you scoot your butt over there and start readin’.

The site has been under construction for over a month and I’ve really missed reading fresh content there. Now that their new layout is up, they have satisfied my cravings with three new articles. I especially enjoyed the [sliding doors](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors) article.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about trying my hand at freelance web design. I think I would have to learn flash first, but some things I’ve read lately have convinced me that the world of freelance design may not be as hard to break into as I had previously thought. I’m not sure I could do it for a living, but I already spend way too much time working on my own site. Why not make a little side money doing something I enjoy?
