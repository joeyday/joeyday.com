I was just chatting with a friend over AOL Instant Messenger. It was the most whacked out conversation I've ever had in my life. Neither of us realized for the first half an hour that the entire conversation was being delayed by about ten minutes. I was trying to respond intelligently to his comments and questions, but little did I realize he had made them five minutes ago and wouldn't receive my answers for another five minutes. He kept saying things that just didn't make any sense. I really worried that he was smoking crack or something.

Later I was able to piece the whole conversation back together and realized that he wasn't just acting crazy. He was really trying hard to reply to my comments, but he probably thought I was smoking something too. We're talking now over MSN Messenger and it seems to be working fine, but that was sure weird.{% include endmark.html %}
