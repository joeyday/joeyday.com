I just finished my final for Math 2210 (Calculus III). The professor allowed us each to have an 8½ by 11 sheet of paper with notes on it. I felt like I did alright, but I'm not expecting anything better than a B. I finished most of the problems and felt good about the answers. I just hope I get a lot of partial credit for the problems I couldn't finish.

My next final is today from 1–1:50pm. Wish me luck!{% include endmark.html %}
