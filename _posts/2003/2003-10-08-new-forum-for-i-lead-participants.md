I’ve added a forum to the site so that I-LEAD 2003 Session II participants can meet to discuss ideas, current events, or anything else that floats your boat. The forum has been located at [ilead.joeyday.com](http://ilead.joeyday.com) (my I-LEAD photo album has moved to another location — it’s still on the menu to the left).

I set this all up pretty quickly last night, so some of the settings might still need tweaking. I’m not sure if everything’s working right or not. Let me know if you experience any difficulty registering or adding stuff.
