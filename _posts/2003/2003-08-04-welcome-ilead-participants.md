Well, I had a lot of fun in Indiana this past week. I met close to 40 people who have quickly become some of my best friends. I'm extremely happy to be back home with everyone I love here (especially my sweetheart, [Janene](http://www.joeyday.com/friends/janene)), but I do miss many of my new friends already.

I got home and checked my site and noticed three errors in the menu. Those shouldn't be there. I've checked with my web hosting company and apparently they were down all day yesterday, so I'm lucky to even have a website. They are still working out a few of the bugs.

Anyway, I just wanted to welcome all of my new friends to JoeyDay.com. Feel free to peruse around and learn about [me](http://www.joeyday.com/about), my [friends](http://www.joeyday.com/friends), and my [family](http://www.joeyday.com/family). I'll try to have the I-LEAD pictures up as soon as possible, but I do have one or two other projects I should finish before I can devote any time to that. When I've got the pictures up I will be sure to send an email out on the listserv.{% include endmark.html %}
