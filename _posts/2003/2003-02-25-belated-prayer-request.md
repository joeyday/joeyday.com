Janene's Granny went into the hospital a few days ago, and I feel bad that I've neglected to say anything about it on the site. She was having kidney problems, and, given that she only has one kidney, everyone was very worried.

She's doing much better now, and has been moved out of the hospital to a smaller medical facility where she can rebuild her strength before they release her.

I would just like to ask all of you to pray that Granny can have a swift recovery and be back on her feet soon. I'm sure she would be thankful for all of your support.{% include endmark.html %}
