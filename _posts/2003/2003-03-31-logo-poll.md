By now most of you have probably noticed the new logo up top. The more I look at it the more I really don’t like it, so I’ve designed several alternatives. Please reply to this post listing your top three choices from the following...

My favorites are #4, #5, and #8, but I’m also partial to #7. Let me know what you all think (maybe you all think I’m just nuts 🤪). Thanks for your participation!{% include endmark.html %}
