I suppose I should write something to end all this nonsense. I had my interview for the UPC Technology Chair about an hour and a half ago. I didn't know who the interview was with until I walked in the room to find half the UPC board in there: Mondi (the current UPC Board Chair), Anne (next year's UPC Board Chair), Jim and Frank (Union staff members), and Dave (the current UPC Technology Chair).

They each took turns asking questions like "What is your best quality and how will you apply it to this position?", "What do you hope to accomplish as Technology Chair?", and "What is your favorite place in the Union, and why?". My favorite one was "What is your definition of 'accountability' and how will you keep that in mind as you provide leadership for your commitee?".

Earlier today I learned that there was one other person who (sortof) applied for Technology Chair. The application for board positions just had all six board chair positions at the top, with instructions to "check all positions you wish to be considered for". This particular applicant actually checked all six boxes! :o He has not served on the council before, so it will be interesting to see if he gets one of the positions.

I feel like I answered the questions well, or at least truthfully. I told them (in answer to the 'accountability' question) that I don't feel as though I am a good leader, and that I will have to learn how to keep my commitee accountable. They told me they appreciated my honesty, and they sounded sincere.

I really hope I get this job. I think I can really do a good job. I'm really glad that today is over and I get to go home now! Thank you everyone for supporting me in seeking this position. I appreciate your thoughts and prayers.{% include endmark.html %}
