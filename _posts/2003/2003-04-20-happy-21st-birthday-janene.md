I want to take a moment and wish my sweetheart, Janene, a very happy 21st birthday.

Janene: You are such a beautiful person. I cannot imagine what my life would be without you in it. You truly are my best friend. You comfort me when Iâ€™m unhappy. You pull me up when I am down. You love me at times when it seems like no one else does. Thank you for showing me by example what unconditional love means. I hope that your birthday finds you in good spirits and that you will be able to accomplish the goals that you have set out for yourself this new year. I love you, sweetheart. Happy birthday!{% include endmark.html %}
