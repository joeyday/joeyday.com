Happy New Year! I've had a very interesting week. On Thursday ContentWatch announced a furlough of 28 employees and pay cuts to a handful of those who stayed. I guess a furlough is just like a layoff but with the slight possibility (and false hope if you ask me) of being called back once the company becomes profitable again. Stu was one of the employees who got furloughed. He writes all about it on his site, [here](http://www.cool-stu.com/daily.html#2). He sounds like he's doing okay, but I'm worried about him nonetheless.

I can't believe school is starting again on Monday. I already got an email from my General Psychology professor outlining some details of class procedures. It also included instructions for logging into the online system we'll be using for some of the assignments. It's all starting up again so fast.

Janene and I went to lunch today and then visited her Grandmother. Granny's doing much better at the rehabilitation facility and it looks like they'll be sending her home on Monday. She's rooming with a lady who broke her hip. The two of them are getting along very wellâ€”cracking jokes and laughing together. It was good to see Granny able to enjoy herself. Once again thanks to all those who've prayed for her and helped her to feel comfortable.{% include endmark.html %}
