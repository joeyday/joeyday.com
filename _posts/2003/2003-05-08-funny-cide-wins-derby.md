Well, the Kentucky Derby was a lot of fun. As always it lasted less than two minutes, but had an hour and a half of commentary. ðŸ˜Š

Funny Cide is the name of the horse that won. The most notable thing about Funny Cide is that he's the first horse bred and raised in New York to win the derby since 1929! I was rooting for a horse named Atswhatimtalkinabout, but he didn't do so well. You can find more information about the derby at [kentuckyderby.com](http://www.kentuckyderby.com/). They even have a replay of the whole race in streaming video.{% include endmark.html %}
