I don't know how many of you heard the news today, but one of television's most beloved personalities passed away this morning. Mr. Rogers died at the age of 74 of stomach cancer. There's a good article about him in the USA Today:

[Children lose a quiet, honest friend](http://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-02-27-mrrogers-usat_x.htm)

I don't know about all of you guys, but I'm kinda going to miss him.{% include endmark.html %}
