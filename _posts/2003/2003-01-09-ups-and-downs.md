The first week of school is almost over, and I'm not failing yet. Cross your fingers for me, okay? Just kidding. ðŸ˜Š On Tuesday I used my ThumbDrive to update the site (the [About](/about) page) from the Multimedia Center on campus. It worked really well. The MMC PCs have Dreamweaver and the USB slots are right on the front of the towerâ€”pretty slick.

Tuesday was another interesting day for ContentWatch. Our Chief Technology Officer resigned. I guess he wasn't happy with some of the restructuring going on and decided to pull out. Understandably, there's a lot of tension and anxiety throughout the office. The President of the company has ensured everyone that ContentWatch has made some neccessary course corrections and is not going out of business any time soon.

I put [EmailProtect](http://www.qksrv.net/click-1180654-9960192) on my computer at work yesterday. So far it seems like a great product. Today when I opened my inbox it said it had blocked two emails, and sure enough both of them were junk. I'm impressed and very much appreciative of such a great program. I know that ContentWatch has several very viable products right now and will continue to progress toward its goals.{% include endmark.html %}
