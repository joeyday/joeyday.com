title:  U.S. Raises Security Threat Level

The United States Government raised our national security threat level from yellow to orange today. You can read the story from Reuters [here](http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?storyID=2192142).

I find it interesting that Attorney General John Ashcroft said that Americans should go about their usual business. What's the point of the security risk level then? If it's something that should only concern the FBI and the CIA, why make it public? So Al Queda can go, "Ooh, they're on orange status. We better leave them alone this month."? I'm probably being overcritical, but I really wonder if it's all just a gimmick to make the American public feel like the government is doing it's job.

Either way, I guess there have been reports suggesting possible terrorist activity this month. They've been attacking low security places like hotels and apartment buildings. If war with Iraq happens I'm sure terrorist activity will increase in the U.S., and how long do you think it will take them to realize that security is being ramped up in places like New York and Los Angelos, and that perhaps they would have more luck attacking smaller towns like Salt Lake? I don't know about you, but that scares the heck out of me.

I agree that if Saddam continues to be non-cooperative we should definately go to war, and possible acts of terrorism shouldn't scare us out of doing what needs to be done. However, I also think we need to start increasing security all over the countryâ€”not just the major cities. They hit where we least expected it the first time. What makes us think they won't hit where we least expect it the second time?{% include endmark.html %}
