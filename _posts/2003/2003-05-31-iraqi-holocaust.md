I found a [NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/01/international/worldspecial/01MISS.html?ex=1055649600&en=2701ad0b7c71bf9d&ei=5004&partner=UNTD) on the mass-graves uncovered recently in Iraq.

This article tells the stories of a handful of Iraqis who survived Hussein's purges and mass-murders. So many people were tortured and slaughtered from 1979 on. When the first President Bush urged Iragis to rebel against Mr. Hussein after the Persian Gulf War, Hussein suppressed and destroyed the rebellion. He slaughtered towns and ethnic groups, all while US troops stood at the borders of his country and did nothing.

My guess is that Mr. Clinton had all the same information George W. Bush had about purges, chemical weapons, and terrorists. Mr. Clinton did nothing. Shame on him.

The Iragi people are becoming more and more upset as they uncover their past and discover the fate of their relatives and loved ones. Who does this article say they are upset at? Americansâ€”and the rest of the world. We waited too long, Iraqis say.
