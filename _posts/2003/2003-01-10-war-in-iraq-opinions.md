I read two Opinion articles in the Trib yesterday that I really liked.

[FRIEDMAN: Little Domestic Support for Iraq Action](http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Feb/02092003/commenta/27529.asp)<br />
[SAFIRE: Irrefutable and Undeniable Evidence](http://www.sltrib.com/2003/Feb/02092003/commenta/27537.asp)

Give â€™em a look and tell me what you think.{% include endmark.html %}
