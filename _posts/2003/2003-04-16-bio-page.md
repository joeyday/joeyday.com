I’d like to try putting up some kind of bio page on The Forum. I think it would be fun for everyone to get to know each other a little better. A bio page would also help visitors (not that we have many) to understand who we are and where we come from.

So, in order for me to have some information to put on the bio page, I’d like everyone to write up a little sumthin’ sumthin’ about themselves, either as a comment to this entry or in an email. Keep in mind this will be posted where anyone can see it, so if you don’t want strangers showing up where you work, don’t include specific information. What I would recommend you include is some basic personal info (age, gender, etc.), your political stance (in as much or as little detail as you like), a little about your hobbies or interests, a recent picture of yourself (if you don’t mind having it on the web), and whatever else you deem appropriate.

Thanks everyone!{% include endmark.html %}
