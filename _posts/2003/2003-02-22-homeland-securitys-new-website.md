Have you all heard of this new site the Department of Homeland Security has set up? I haven't had a chance to look through the whole site, but apparently there are instructions for setting up a terrorism survival kit, directions for disaster-proofing your home, and an outline for a family plan in the event of a terrorist attack near your home.

The site is located at [Ready.gov](http://www.ready.gov).

I found it somewhat interesting, and I definately feel it is worth a second look. However, from what I understand the government is getting a lot of flack over it. Certain people seem to think that a website of this nature only serves to scare the general public and put our nation on edge. I tend to believe it is better to be prepared, and I applaud the government for trying to help americans to understand the importance of being ready.{% include endmark.html %}
