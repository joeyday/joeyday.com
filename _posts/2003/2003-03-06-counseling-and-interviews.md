I signed up to see a Computer Science counselor next Tuesday. Applications for full major status are due toward the end of the semester, and I want to make sure I have all my hens in a row.

Speaking of Tuesday, that's the same day I'm scheduled to be interviewed for the position of UPC Technology Chair. I'm rather confident I'll get the job, but I'm still nervous any time I get interviewed. I'm always scared that I'll say something really stupid.

Janene's family is having a sort of crisis this week. One of their dogs, a rather large husky/malamute named Salter, has contracted a nasty gastro-intestinal disease. He's stopped eating and everyone is very worried that he may die soon. Janene's sister, Christene, is a veteranary technician, and is doing all she can to make him feel comfortable and give him the care he needs. The whole situation is causing some emotional tension in the home, and it may effect them financially as well, depending on how much it could cost to perform some of the procedures Salter may need. I would like to ask everyone to pray for Janene's family that they can make it through this.{% include endmark.html %}
