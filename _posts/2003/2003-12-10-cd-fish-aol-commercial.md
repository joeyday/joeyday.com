I’m not exactly sure why, but lately I’ve had something against every AOL commercial I’ve seen. The latest one is no different.

The commercial starts with a woman opening her mail. She discovers a new AOL CD, and immediately rushes over to her husband exclaiming, “It’s here! It’s here!” The camera then focuses on one wall in the house, where there is a sculpture of a fish made entirely of AOL CDs. The husband drops the new CD into the last open space (the fish’s eye), and they proudly admire their finally finished work.

Then Jerry Stiller shows up out of nowhere. He explains to them that the new CD has AOL 9.0, and they really ought to give it a try because it’s better than all the old versions. I’m not sure I even have to say anything here. Everyone makes fun of AOL for the number of free CDs they send out. Now they’re making fun of themselves! :duh

If you’ve received too many AOL CDs, send them to [No More AOL CDs](http://www.nomoreaolcds.com). These guys have collected over 250,000 CDs. Their goal is to collect a million and then give them back to AOL to try and get their message across. I, for one, hope they succeed.
