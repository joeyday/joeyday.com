Janene and I saw a great band last night. They are a contemporary Christian rock band from North Carolina (now based in Tennessee) called [The Swift](http://www.the-swift.com/). Their style is sortof a cross between Billy Joel and Ben Foldsâ€”but with a definite Christian twist. They came out to our church to lead a worship service.

What sets them apart from other bands is that they don't focus on guitars and drums, but rather on the piano. Their style is definately rock, but the piano sets a fun jazz/ragtime tone to their music. What really impressed me is that they didn't come just to perform. They got everyone involved, told stories, shared scriptures, and really challenged everyone to re-evaluate their relationship with God. If you are interested in hearing a fresh sound from some guys who know where their priorities should be, check out The Swift.{% include endmark.html %}

[They don't have any music clips on their website. The only place where I did find some samples was on [ChristianBook.com](https://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product/?item_no=CD26122&p=1006648).]
