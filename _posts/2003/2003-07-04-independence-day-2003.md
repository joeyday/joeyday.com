Happy 4th of July! I just want to say that I'm extremely grateful for this country and the freedoms we have. I also want to say thank you to the men and women serving in our country's military programs throughout the world, and recognize the many soldiers who have laid down their life in defense of this nation.

For the rest of the month of July, I'd like to concentrate on patriotism. I'm going to be posting the Constitution and the Declaration of Independance (and possibly other major U.S. documents of interest) in the Articles section, and I've already added a new emoticon to the site. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Be sure to check back soon to see what I add next...

What do you think of the new emoticon?{% include endmark.html %}
