I would like to wish everyone a very happy Easter Sunday. I hope that all of us can take a few moments today to think about what we are celebrating. On this day in history, circa 33 A.D., Christ broke the bonds of death for all time when He rose from His tomb. He paved the way, through His sacrifice and resurrection, that all men might be reconciled to God and inherit eternal life. Jesus truly is our living hope. May God richly bless all of us with a greater knowledge of who He is and what He has done for us.{% include endmark.html %}
