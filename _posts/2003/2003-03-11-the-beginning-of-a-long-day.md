Today is going to be interesting. I've got an appointment with a computer science department counselor this morning around 9am, followed by a meeting with the UPC Technology Committee around 10:30. Then I have a little bit of time to eat lunch before my 12:25 Symphonic Band class. That class gets out around 1:45, and at 2:20 I have my interview for UPC Technology Chair.

I'll let you all know how the day turns out, but if anyone is reading this between 2:20 and 2:40 this afternoon, throw a little prayer my way, would ya please? Thanks!{% include endmark.html %}
