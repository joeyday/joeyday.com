It's official. Tonight I was granted FTP access to the Union server. You can now view the most recent Union beta at [www.union.utah.edu/beta](http://www.union.utah.edu/beta).

I spent a couple of hours up at the UPC office today. They did some major remodelling over the weekend. A couple of walls have been removed and the whole office seems a lot less cramped. It also seemed brighter somehow. I think I will really enjoy working there now. It's a much more comfortable space.

I also mowed the lawn today. UGH ðŸ˜•. I don't think it was mowed for over a month. I had to empty the bag almost once every row! I hereby solemnly vow not to let it go this long again.{% include endmark.html %}
