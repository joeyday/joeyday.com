I saw this tonight on a TV show called "The Pulse".

[Dolphins Sent to Gulf to Hunt Mines](http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/news/iraq/0303/26irdolphins.html)

That's right, the marines have employed dolphins (despite animal rights activists' protests) to search out and tag underwater mines so that bomb crews can come in and disarm them. Even in murky water where a human could only see a few feet ahead, the dolphins can "see" the mines up to thousands of feet away with the help of their built-in sonar systems. They are taught specifically not to touch the mines, and as long as they are trained correctly there is no direct danger to them.

I think this is a great idea. Rather than spend billions of dollars on some kind of little unmanned, sonar equipped, mine searching submarine, why not train a dolphin? It just makes sense, and I think it's really cool.{% include endmark.html %}
