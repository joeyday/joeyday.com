I've finally recreated the [Friends](http://www.joeyday.com/friends) section. It was lost when I moved from Hosting Matters over to Onsmart. Nobody seems to have thrown a big stink about it being gone, but I'm glad it's back up.

The only complaint I did receive was an automatic message sent by a bot that was trying to traverse the site. I guess the bot was programmed to send a message when it encountered a broken link, which I suppose is kindof polite. I already knew about the problem though, so it wasn't very helpful.{% include endmark.html %}
