Just figured I would say HI to everyone here... :) Anywho... Has anyone here read any of Gerald Lund's books. I just read one yesterday. It is an interesting story about what life would be like in the United States if the Constitution had never been ratified. And to make a long story short... it was pretty bad. To find out more you had better read the book. It is called "The Freedom Factor". Yeah it has a little romance, but still the story line is pretty interesting. Anyways I was wondering what others thought about all of these ppl who want to take away our Right to Bear Arms. And so on like that. Or maybe our right to free speech. With the Congress wanting to let the CIA or whatever, have more freedom to spy on ppl that they think are a threat to our country. Whether or not they have the evidence. Or to get the evidence that they need to. Anyways that was in the news like almost 10 months ago so I may be a little rusty on that topic. I guess I just feel that we need our Constitution. And so on.
