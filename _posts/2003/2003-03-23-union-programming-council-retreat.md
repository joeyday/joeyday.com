I mentioned earlier that the transition to the new UPC Chairs would happen April 18–19, but there's now been a slight change of plans. I was not aware, but the transition process involves a retreat of some sort, and seeing as how the 18th and 19th are Easter weekend this year, they've moved the retreat up to April 11–12. I have no idea where we are going or what they plan to do, as I still have not received any information via email (Mondi called me last night to tell me about the rescheduling).

I'm really starting to look forward to this position, and can't wait to meet the other council members. I think I've met some of them but never really got to know them. The retreat should be a good place for us to familiarize ourselves with one another.{% include endmark.html %}
