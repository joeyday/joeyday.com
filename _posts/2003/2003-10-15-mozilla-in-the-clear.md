**Bad news:** Microsoft has released the [details](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/activexchanges.asp) of future changes to Internet Explorer. They‚Äôre being forced to change it because of a recent lawsuit involving a small company called Eolas. Eolas is owned and operated by one man, Michael Doyle, who patented the concept of plug-ins back in 1994. Microsoft will probably put this change out as a Windows Update in early 2004.

**Good news:** In a [recent interview](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1304247,00.asp), Doyle explained that free browsers like Mozilla are exempt from any royalties. What this means, of course, as that they won‚Äôt have to stop using plug-ins.

bq.. **eWEEK.com:** What would you say to Web developers \[or those few competing browser makers out there\] who are concerned they‚Äôll have to purchase some sort of an expensive license to be able to do this?

**Doyle:** I think the key word there is ‚Äúexpensive.‚Äù . . . We have from the beginning had a general policy of providing non-commercial users royalty-free licenses. We expect to be paid for the commercial use of our technologies.

p. One more reason to switch to Firebird, folks. üôÇ
