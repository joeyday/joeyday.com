My father's birthday is today. I've always thought his was the ideal birthday. June 25 is exactly halfway between Christmases. He left this morning to go on a business trip, so he's not around to celebrate anything. ☹️

Happy Birthday, Dad! Just thinking about all of the crazy stuff you do (e.g. the heat convection pipe and water powered engine in the backyard) makes me smile. It also makes me realize that my dad's a pretty cool guy. I hope that everything goes well on your trip and that you are blessed with safe travel. I love you, Dad.{% include endmark.html %}
