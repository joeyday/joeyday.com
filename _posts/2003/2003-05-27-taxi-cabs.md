title:	Taxi Cabs—Advertising with Pinpoint Accuracy

At dinner tonight we were talking about taxi cabs, so I did a Google search to find a picture of one. I stumbled across a very interesting article in the New York Times and thought I would share it.

[Hail A Cab, Read A Commercial](http://www.adaptmedia.net/Hail%20a%20Cab,%20Read%20a%20Commercial.htm)

The article focuses on some new signs that are being installed on cabs in New York. The signs are controlled by global positioning satellite and cellular communication devices, and are remotely programmed to display specific ads in specific parts of town. This would make it possible for a store to advertise a sale only within six blocks of the store and only on the day of the sale. I think the most interesting line in the whole article is, “If advertisers wanted to communicate in Chinese in Chinatown or in Spanish in East Harlem, they could do that, too.”
