I would really like to know why some prisoners get better benefits than those on the outside. Why are some prisoners allowed to get GED's or watch television for endless hours? Why are some of them treated better than people that are homeless???

Please tell me why [this women](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91598,00.html) is allowed to receive email?!?! I remember when she killed her kids. People like her should be thrown into a dark, dank cell and left to rot.

Sorry... I'll come down off my soapbox now.
