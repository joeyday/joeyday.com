I realize how extremely nerdy this is, but please bear with me. I've created a new section of JoeyDay.com to keep track of chess games I've played. The new [Chess](http://www.joeyday.com/chess) section already includes about eight games (I've recorded over 30 more that will eventually be added). I'm still playing around with the layout of the section, so be sure to wear your hard hat if you're going in there. ðŸ˜Š{% include endmark.html %}
