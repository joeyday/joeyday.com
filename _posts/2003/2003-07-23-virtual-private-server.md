I’m excited. In the last couple of months, my brother-in-law, Steve, and I have been contemplating getting our own server in order to get a better price for web hosting. Recently, we’ve been corresponding extensively with [OnSmart Networks](http://www.onsmart.com) (a New York based company that I’m currently hosting JoeyDay.com with) about setting up a virtual private server. We have been greatly impressed with every answer they’ve given so far. It’s really looking like this will be a great way to get cheaper hosting and every feature we could dream of. As of right now the plan is to have the server up and running on August 10.

We’ve already spoken with five individuals who have committed to hosting a domain on our server. Including Steve and I, the $50/mo cost of the server will be split seven ways, which totals out to $7.15 per person. If we get too crowded within the 1GB of space we’re allotted, an extra GB only costs another ten bucks a month (about a dollar extra per person).

We’ll be sending out an email by the end of the month that will have information about the plan and some basic terms of agreement; we’ve got a PayPal account set up so that people can login to pay the monthly dues by credit card; and we’ve secured the domain, [FellowSites.org](http://www.fellowsites.org) (not up yet) for use as a headquarters for payment and information purposes.

If you are interested in hosting with us, [let us know](<mailto:fellowsites@ourlittlenook.com?subject=I want to host with FellowSites!>).
