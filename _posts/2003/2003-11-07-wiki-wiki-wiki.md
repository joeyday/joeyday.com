[SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com) has put out a [new article that features wikis](http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1241) — what they are, why they work, who should use them, etc. It’s written by the same guy who mentioned wikis in an article a few weeks ago. Most of the arguments and explanations he presents can be found on most wikis already, but it is nice to see them presented clearly and succinctly in one place.

One thing that interested me is that he spends a lot of time talking about a stand-alone personal wiki called [Notebook](http://www.wjduquette.com/notebook) (what an original name, eh?). I’ve downloaded it to my computer and I’m this close to using it for my personal journaling in place of Movable Type. Up till now I’ve kept a password protected personal blog in an unadvertised location. I’ll let you know what I decide.
