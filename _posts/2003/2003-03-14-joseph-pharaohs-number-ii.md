Here's a free date idea!

Everyone is invited to see Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat produced by the Provo, Utah South Stake.

**What**: FREE Musical production of Joseph<br />
**Where**: Provo, Utah South Stake Center, 835 South 500 West in Provo<br />
**When**: Thursday, Friday, Saturday March 20–22; 7:30 PM<br />

For crowd control, the stake wants everyone to have tickets (but the show is free). If you need tickets, e-mail [Steve](mailto:huntik@byu.edu) ASAP.
