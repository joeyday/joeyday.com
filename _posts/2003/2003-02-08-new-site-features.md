I've updated a lot of things on the site. First, I've implemented a universal menu to the left. This menu is being generated once, and then included in the main page and every individual archive page.

Second, the link on each entry's time will now take you to that entry's individual archive page, where you can view the whole entry along with any comments that have been added to it.

Third, I've cleaned up some of the commenting pages—most notably the comment previewing pages. They now have a similar format to all the other pages, and give you a much better idea of what your comment is actually going to look like.

Last but not least, I've found a way to implement emoticons. The following emoticons can now be added to your posts (I hope to include more in the future):

“: - )” or “: )” — (without spaces) will produce 😊<br />
“: - (” or “: (” — (without spaces) will produce 😟<br />
“: - D” or “: D” — (without spaces) will produce 😀

Let me know what the most important emoticons are to you and I'll try to get them up first.

The site is really coming along, eh? Let me know what you think I should change or add to the site to make it a little better. Thanks!{% include endmark.html %}
