If anyone checked the site this morning, you noticed that I was hacked sometime in the middle of the night. While the details remain somewhat of a mystery, the hacker somehow gained priviliged access to the server that all of [FellowSites](http://www.fellowsites.org) is hosted on. Thankfully, he didn’t do any major damage. He ran a simple script that searched for index pages on the server, backed up the pages, and then replaced the originals with an [index page of his own](/archives/hacked.html).

Steve and I have been in contact with the reseller host most of the morning. Everyone’s pages are back to normal and they’ve fixed the security vulnerability so that it won’t happen again. They also got the culprit’s IP address and they’ve banned him from the server.
