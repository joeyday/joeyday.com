Lisa sent Janene this picture of Libby last night. Look how cute she is! Maybe someday she'll be famous and I'll be able to say I had the first picture of her on my website. ðŸ˜Š

The second week of Spring Semester 2003 will be over tomorrow. We've got a three day weekend coming up so I'm kindof excited. My first WebWork assignment was due yesterday and I'm happy to say I was able to complete it fairly easily. Seeing as how it's the first one of the semester I can only guess they'll get harder from here.

My Psychology class will be posting a lot of class material on WebCT, but they haven't been able to get it going for some reason. I guess the University upgraded to a new system and a lot of classes have been affected slightly. It's amazing (and sometimes a little scary) how a university education these days really relies heavily on the Internet. I'd say over two thirds of my classes at the U have had some form of email list, and at least half have had a class webpage where they posted assignments and other handouts. Crazy!

Janene and I went to a rehearsal Monday night for a local city concert band (a friend from church sortof recruited us). The band is made up of older people from all over the community who get together once a week at a local junior high school. They also perform in concert from time to time. They're having a concert in February and I guess they've got a need for percussionists. They seemed like quite a shabby group, but it was obvious to me that they have a lot of fun together. Janene and I were about the youngest ones there, so I felt somewhat out of place. I think I'll keep going to rehearsals and perform with them in February, but I'm not sure what I'll do after that.{% include endmark.html %}
