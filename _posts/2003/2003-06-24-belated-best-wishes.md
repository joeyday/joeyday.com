Sorry it's been such a long while since I've said anything on this site. I feel bad because I missed three very important things during the past month:

Happy Anniversary, Janene! (Janene and I celebrated the two year anniversary of our first date on June 7. We had a lot of fun hanging out at Lagoon.) I just want to tell you how important you are to me. We've been through a lot of ups and downs together, and I want you to know that I have loved you completely through the good and the bad.

Happy Birthday Merissa! (Merissa's 22nd birthday was June 13.) I just want to say that I love you very much. Congratulations are also in order for the precious bundle on it's way in December. I'm excited that I'll be Uncle Joey soon!

Happy Father's Day, Dad! (Father's day was June 15.) I'm extremely blessed to have you for my father. You have always been a solid example for me in a world where examples are sometimes hard to find.

I just want to say that I'm sorry to all three of you for not posting anything here sooner. I love you guys and wish the best for you all!{% include endmark.html %}
