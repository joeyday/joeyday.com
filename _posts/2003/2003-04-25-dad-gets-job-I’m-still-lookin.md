title:	Dad Gets Job—I’m Still Lookin’

My dad got a job yesterday. He’s working for a company called [iTera Inc.](http://www.iterainc.com/) As near as I can understand, they help companies set up redundant computer systems so that in the event of one system going down, the backup system can take over so the company doesn’t lose critical system functions. He has his own office in the building, but they will be sending him out of town on consulting jobs once in a while. It should be a pretty good job for him.

I applied for a job down at Circuit City. The lady said over the phone that they were hiring, but when I got there they said they were "taking applications", but not necessarily hiring—whatever that means. After I completed the application and took a 45 minute test, I wandered around in the store a bit. They have a lot of cool stuff. I think it would be a lot of fun to work there.

School ended Wednesday. Now all that’s left is finals. I have two finals on Monday and one on Thursday. I’m not going to take any classes over the summer since I can’t really afford it right now. I really need to get my job situation squared away first.{% include endmark.html %}
