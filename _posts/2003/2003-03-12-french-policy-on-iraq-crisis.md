title:  French Policy on Iraq Crisis

Over the last few weeks I've been writing about a lecture series at the University about the Iraqi-American conflict. The last lecture in the series took place yesterday, and I was unable to attend on account of my UPC Technology Chair interview.

Anyway, an article came out in the Chrony today about the lecture. You can read the article by clicking the following link:

[Paris and the Middle East: Making Sense of French Politics](http://www.dailyutahchronicle.com/main.cfm/include/detail/storyid/391240.html)

This article helped me to gain a better understanding of why France and Germany have problems with the idea of starting a war in Iraq. It's still difficult for me to see a way to get Saddam out of there without some kind of conflict, and this whole situation has really gone on longer than it should have, but I can see how this war could really start a chain reaction with a lot of nasty repercussions.

I have complete faith that the U.S. Military can take Saddam out without creating unnecessary casualties. However, I personally think we aren't doing enough to get the rest of the world on our side. If we violate the U.N. as we go to war with Iraq, I'm really afraid that we will only create more enemies for ourselves (Listen to me... I sound like a Democrat! ðŸ˜›).{% include endmark.html %}
