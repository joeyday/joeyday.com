So, a few weeks ago my friend Mike wrote in [his blog](http://www.xmission.com/~gibson/mike) about people using [punctuation around passwords](http://www.xmission.com/~gibson/mike/archives/000029.html) and other information that should be word-perfect.

Case in point: today I got an email at work from a lady who wanted her [ContentCleanup](http://www.contentwatch.com/cleanup) login information changed. Here’s a direct quote from her email:

> Please change my username to: minette;ihjl, and my password to:  
> \[ommitted\]

Now, she did put the password on a new line with no punctuation around it, but what about that username? Is that comma part of it, or no? Luckily, the ContentCleanup username should always be a valid email address, so this one’s bogus with or without the comma, but it’s still confusing. ![](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/endmark.png "End mark")
