Janene recently completed a website for her Professional Writing class up at the U. The topic of her website is [Stress Management](http://www.joeyday.com/friends/janene/stress). I've given her site it's own directory on JoeyDay.com. You can get to it from the link above or from Janene's page in the [Friends](http://www.joeyday.com/friends/janene/stress) section. I think she did a wonderful job.

I know everyone's going to think I made it for her, but I didn't. I taught her HTML and she did the bulk of the coding by herself. On the day it was due her class went to the computer lab (at the Sandy campus) so they could put the finishing touches on their sites and upload them. Since hers was already uploaded she used the time to help other people fix their HTML. I hope this experience has helped her to appreciate what I'd like to do for a living. ðŸ˜Š{% include endmark.html %}
