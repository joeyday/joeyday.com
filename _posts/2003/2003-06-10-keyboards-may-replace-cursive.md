This board has been slow for a bit, so I'm going to add something. I found [this article](http://www.msnbc.com/news/922690.asp?0dm=T14MT) online today at MSN. I remember learning cursive in 3rd grade. I remember slanting my paper... and lining up each letter and having it reach clear from the bottom to the top. I think David and I talked about this once. I remember being more meticulous in my practices... while he said he just didn't really do the lessons and just sort of quickly wrote things out. Guess which one out of the two of us has better handwriting today? ðŸ˜‰

It's so odd that many people don't use cursive anymore because of computers and keyboards. The article goes on to add some quotes from an artist about how children don't even know how to properly hold a pencil. This is so true! I can't even tell you how often teachers in my drawing classes will actually explain how to hold the pencil because most individuals hold it completely incorrect. We are even encourage to practice basic strokes because it further develops your hand coordination, which many people don't have.

The article later goes on to say that penmanship is a "part of your inner being, your core, your worth. ..." I always thought it was really neat to see how people wrote. It certainly says a lot about someone and how much effort and care they are willing to put into something... something so small as your own handwriting. I still use cursive today... in fact I prefer it to regular handwriting. What about you? Do you still use cursive? Do you think children should still be taught cursive in today's schools? Do you think you're handwriting could be improved? I love cursive, yet I know very few people who are older that still use it regularly. I think if people really knew how much their own handwriting says about them... they would try and improve it.
