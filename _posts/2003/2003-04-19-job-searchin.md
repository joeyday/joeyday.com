Yet again my direct deposit has not gone through on the day it was supposed to. This comes at an especially unfortunate time because I really wanted to take my sweetheart out to dinner for her birthday tonight. This is only made worse by the fact that Karma cut my hours again this week. I'm now working 12 hours a week instead of 15â€”oh, and let's not forget that Karma asked me not to come in yesterday, which means I really only worked 8 hours this week. ðŸ˜•

In response to all of this run around I've decided to start a job search. I've decided that over the last 10 months I've gained some valuable sales experience, and it might just be possible for me to get a job at someplace like Circuit City or CompUSA. I started calling around and it turns out the Circuit City closest to my home is hiring right now. I think I'll go in Monday night or Tuesday afternoon to fill out an application. I've also considered the Gateway Store and the Compaq Store, but haven't tried calling them yet. If anyone has any other ideas, I'm open to them. Wish me luck!{% include endmark.html %}
