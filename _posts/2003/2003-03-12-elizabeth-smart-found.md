I honestly have no idea what to say. Call me insensitive and pessimistic, but I really had no hope for her being alive past August last year. I guess I was wrong!

In case you haven't heard (and I have no idea how you haven't), Elizabeth Smart was spotted today walking down the street in Sandy. There have been so many articles written about the story that it would take me a while to list them here, and you've probably read them all, so I won't. However, I discovered one article that really suprised me. This has got to be one of the more twisted parts of the whole story:

[Elizabeth Smart May Have Been Photographed With Street Preacher At Party in September](http://kutv.com/specialsection/local_story_071193346.html)

Some guy at a party last September took some pictures of Brian David Mitchell (Smart's kidnapper), along with two women with veiled faces. I don't blame the photographer at all for not turning in the pictures sooner, since Mitchell wasn't a suspect until October/November, but even then the media didn't know about him until February, when they began releasing photos and sketches of the guy. I just think it's nuts that for at least part of the last eight months she's been walking around in broad daylight and nobody could see the forest for the trees. Scary. ðŸ˜³{% include endmark.html %}
