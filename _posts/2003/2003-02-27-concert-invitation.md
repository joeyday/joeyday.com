It's very late, and I really should be going to bed, but I want to put this up before I forget. The University of Utah Symphonic Band (of which I am a part) will be performing Monday night at Libby Gardner Hall. I can get free tickets, so if you'd like to come please [email me](mailto:tickets@joeyday.com) or add a comment to this post before Monday. Be sure and let me know you are coming as early as you can or you might be out of luck. Hope to see you all there! ðŸ˜Š{% include endmark.html %}
