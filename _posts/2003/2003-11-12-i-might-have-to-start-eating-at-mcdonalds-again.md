I’ve never been a big fan of McDonald’s, but something I read today might be big enough to change my mind. I was bored at work so I picked up a business magazine that’s lying on a file cabinet behind me. There was an article in there about [McDonald’s](http://www.mcdonalds.com) offering wireless Internet in all of their stores in Taiwan. The article (seeing as how it is in a business magazine) dealt mostly with the logistics of setting up the network, and didn’t say much about the U.S.

Inquisitive minds want to know, so I quickly Googled “McDonald’s Wireless Internet” and lo and behold, there are several U.S. locations that already offer wi-fi connections for laptop users with wireless capabilities. They are in major metropolitan areas (of course) such as Chicago and New York, but it is also available in Seattle (one more reason to move there). You can find more information at [mcdwireless.com](http://www.mcdwireless.com).

I guess I may be a little slow in realizing all this though, since according to some articles I read (like [this one](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,54697,00.html)), [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com) has had wi-fi in most of their U.S. stores for some time now.
