Just when I was starting to really like Hockey. I've been telling Janene for the last few months that we ought to go see a Ute Hockey game. Unfortunately, the University of Utah Skatin' Utes team has been suspended from the league by University Officials. They cited several past violations of University policy, including driving a rented van after midnight while on a roadtrip, allowing a high school student to play and travel with the team, and allowing two students to fly home from an away game in a private airplane (BYU Newsnet also claims that it's because of some things that our team did at games against BYU).

I heard about all this in a couple articles in the Utah Chronicle yesterday, and the BYU Newsnet article came out today.

I'm really bummed about this. I wish I would've gone and seen them kick BYU's butts at least once. ðŸ˜Ÿ{% include endmark.html %}
