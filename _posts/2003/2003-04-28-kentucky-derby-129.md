It's that time of year again. The 129th Kentucky Derby will be this Saturday, May 3, 2003. The Derby will be shown on NBC (Channel 5 KSL here in Utah) from 3 -- 4:30pm MST. More information about the derby can be found at kentuckyderby.com.

There is a lot of tradition surrounding the derby. Of all the traditions I'd have to say Derby Pie is my favorite. Derby Pie is basically a pecan pie with chocolate chips. It's very simple, but it's pretty tasty. I found a good Derby Pie recipe online and I thought I'd post it here in case anyone wants to try it out.

## Chocolate Chip Cookie Pie (a.k.a. Derby Pie)

2 eggs
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 cup melted butter, cooled
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup chopped pecans (or use 2 cups chips and leave out the pecans)
1 9-inch unbaked pie shell

Beat eggs well in large bowl. Add flour and sugars and mix until well blended. Stir in the melted butter. Add chips and pecans (if using). Pour into unbaked pie shell, and bake at 325 degrees for 55-65 minutes until puffy and golden brown. Makes 12 servings.{% include endmark.html %}
