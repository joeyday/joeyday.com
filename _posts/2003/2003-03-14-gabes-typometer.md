A few months ago (Stu will know what I'm talking about) I downloaded a fun little freeware app that tracked how far my mouse had travelled. It even gave you links to download (relatively) cool stuff for each mile you reached. Well, the program was horribly buggy (perhaps Win XP problems?) and I deleted it a few short weeks after I downloaded it.

Now I have found something similar, but much more practical in my opinion. I was looking for a good freeware typing tutor program, and stumbled across a freeware typing speedometer. It has a needle that shows how fast you are currently typing in key-presses per minute and WPM. It also has several other indicators that track your average and maximum WPM, along with your average over the last ten seconds, so that after you've typed something you can look at it and see how fast you were just going. Plus, it keeps track of your total key-presses, words, and mouse clicks.

You can read more about it and download it [here](http://www.informatics.no/progvareTMLoc.htm). It's free, and as far as I know does not contain any spyware. Have fun!{% include endmark.html %}
