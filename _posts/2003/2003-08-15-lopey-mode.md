Lopey is a word I invented in high school before I discovered the word "[discombobulated](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=discombobulated)". It very much describes how I feel right now.

School is just around the corner, and I really only have one project to finish before then. I have been working on the [new Union site](http://test.union.utah.edu/) a lot with Stuart, and we are getting pretty close to finishing.

I'm really looking forward to school starting because it will give me something important to do with all of this time I have just laying around. At the same time I'm feeling extremely apprehensive, as I haven't been in the swing of school for what feels like forever, and I'm about to start probably the most packed semester of my college career to date. I'll be working approximately 23 hours at ContentWatch, fulfilling 6 office hours at the UPC (plus a 2 hour meeting every week), and taking 12 credit hours of classes (comprised of Family Studies, Linear Algebra, Survey of Jazz, and World Civilizations) each week. Yikes!

At any rate, it's hard for me to believe that school starts in less than a week (August 20). There are so many things I wish I had done this summer and now I can't go back and do them. I should've gotten the Union website done months ago, and I would've liked to have redesigned JoeyDay.com and The Forum. I also could've spent some valuable time putting together my application for full major status.
