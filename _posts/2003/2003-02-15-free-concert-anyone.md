Janene and I went to a rehearsal this morning for the community concert band we are involved with. There is a performance tonight at 7:30pm at a local middle school. If you'd like to come, shoot me an email and I'll send you the details. Be prepared, though. I've noticed a strong sense of unity in this band, but it certainly has nothing to do with tempo or intonation (if you know what I mean ðŸ˜‰).

I had a great Valentine's Day. Janene made dinner for me last nightâ€”Chicken Parmesan, Yum! She also gave me a Michael W. Smith CD, a nice tie, and a really stylish pocket watch with my initials engraved on it. I've always wanted a nice pocket watch, and I'm very grateful for her thoughtfulness.{% include endmark.html %}
