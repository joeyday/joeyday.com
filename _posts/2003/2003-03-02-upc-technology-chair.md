title:  UPC Technology Chair?

I'm applying to be the Union Programming Council Technology Chair up at the University. The UPC organizes most of the events and activities that happen in and around the Union building. The Technology Chair is in charge of designing and maintaining the Union website ([www.union.utah.edu](http://www.union.utah.edu)) and keeping the UPC computers in good running condition.

I spent most of yesterday typing up a cover letter and a resume. It isn't due until Wednesday, March 5, but I think I'll turn it in on Monday. As far as I know there is no one else applying for the position, and I have the recommendation of the current Technology Chair. I don't want to get my hopes up all the way, but I am fairly certain I'll get the position.

As confident as I am, I would still like to ask everyone to pray for me. Please pray first of all that I will be able to get the job, and second that I will be able to live up to the expectations of the UPC and the Union staff. Thanks!{% include endmark.html %}
