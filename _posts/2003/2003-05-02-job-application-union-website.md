I applied for a job this morning with Vector Marketing Corporation. They currently have openings for full time customer service reps with wages starting at $12.50/hr. I heard about them from a letter that Janene's sister Christene received in the mail. Apparently they really like studentsâ€”the letter mentioned the opportunity to stay on part time in the fall when school starts up again. The letter also mentioned that no experience is required, but I'm hoping ten months of experience at ContentWatch will play in my favor.

I applied online, and within an hour I received a phone call from them wanting to set up an appointment to interview me tomorrow! I told the lady I have a really busy day tomorrow, so she's going to call me again on Monday.

I've also been working on the new Union website. You can see the latest design at union.joeyday.com/beta1.2. If anyone has ideas as to how it can be improved upon, send me an email.{% include endmark.html %}
