As of yesterday I have been posting fairly regular entries to Qangaroo.com (and now JoeyDay.com) for a whole year! Can you believe it? Isn't that nerdy? Thank you.

Also, yesterday was Mike's birthday. Happy Birthday, Mike! So you've hit the big two seven, eh? That's not so bad. You're only four years ahead of me, so you aren't quite a geezer, yet. I hope everything is going well for you and Lisa and Libby.
