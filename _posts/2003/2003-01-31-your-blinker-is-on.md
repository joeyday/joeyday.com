title:  Your Blinker Is On

A funny thing happened today on my way home from school. I was tooling down the freeway, and a guy merged in front of me from the lane to my left. After merging, he left his right blinker on.

I did what I normally do in this situation. Namely, I pulled over a lane, passed him, pulled in front of him, and left _my_ blinker on. The idea here is that he'll go, "Look at that idiot leaving his blinker on", and then realize, "Oh shoot, mine's on too." Well, this guy did not get the hint. I went probably two or three miles in front of the guy with my left blinker on!

The best part of the story is that I finally gave up (I was getting close to my exit) and pulled over two lanes so I could get off. What do I see next, but _another_ guy in front of him trying to get his attention by flashing his hazard lights for a few seconds at a time every minute or so. The guy just would not get the hint! Has this ever been one of those "things that must go" on X96? If it hasn't, it should be.{% include endmark.html %}
