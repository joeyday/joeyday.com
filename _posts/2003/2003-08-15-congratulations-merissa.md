Merissa graduated from BYU last night with a teaching degree. Her focus was on elementary education.

Merissa: Thanks for always being such a great sister and a great example to me. You are always so determined to reach your goalsâ€”something I know I am lacking most of the time. I'm so happy for you that you have endured through these years at school and come out with a clear victory! I wish you the best of luck as you begin your career in the teaching field. I know you will do a great job! Congrats!{% include endmark.html %}
