I saw this [story](http://www.newsnet5.com/news/2331915/detail.html) on our local news (channel 4) last night. I couldn't find a link for it, but today while perusing a bulletin board I frequent, I discovered that someone had found a link to the story.

After watching the story, it really creeped me out. This not only happened on one camera... but three seperate ones. They only display a few images on this site, but last night on the news... they showed quite a few. It was rather freaky.

Here's [another article](http://wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/9onyourkidsside/200f2b7c.html) I was able to dig out.
