I feel like I've finally arrived. I have business cards ðŸ˜„. This UPC job is really spoiling me. They've already booked me for an I-LEAD leadership conference in Indiana around the first of August. They've also offered me the opportunity to go to an EMS conference in Colorado in mid-July. EMS stands for Event Management System, and it is a software product the Union is going to start using. It's mostly going to be used by our reservations secretaries, but they want me to know how to use it since I'll be implementing a web interface so that individuals and organizations can log onto our website to book reservations in the Union building.

So, business cards are fun. I already gave one out when I met the ASUU Technology Director. He runs the [ASUU](http://www.asuu.utah.edu/) and [ULife](http://ulife.asuu.utah.edu/home) websites. From what I understand, he's really interested in working more closely with other organizations this year, which is exactly what I was hoping for. ULife is an excellent program and probably one of the most recognized names on campus.

In other news, I got a paycheck today for $132. Needless to say I'm a little pissed off. If I haven't been motivated to find a job lately, I think that about did it. I got online tonight and finished filling out my resume at [jobs.utah.gov](http://jobs.utah.gov/). Then I went through and printed out all the job listings I'm qualified for. Some of them wouldn't let me see the contact info because I haven't taken a typing test. First thing Monday I'm gonna go down to a Workforce Services office and take one. Depending on whether they'll let me use Dvorak, I'm confident that I'll score at least 60 WPM. I won't rest on Monday until I've either got a job or applied for more than twenty. Wish me luck.{% include endmark.html %}
