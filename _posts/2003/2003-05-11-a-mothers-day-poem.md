In May the flowers start to bloom
And birds begin to sing.
With many colored crest and plume
They celebrate the spring.

The trees begin to sway and dance
When moved by slightest breeze.
And though it's hard to tell first glance,
The sun seems more at ease.

In May the world is â€™wakening;
Indeed a special time.
But though the prose is in full swing,
Don't misconstrue this rhyme.

For this is not about May trees,
May birds, May flowers fair.
But reason for the placement of
A holiday that's there.

For when the world was wont to frame
A day our moms to praise.
It chose a month with careful aim;
Ensuring it conveys:

A boundless grace, a beauty sweet,
A kindness true and fair.
A perfect peace, a joy complete,
A love beyond compare.

Today I want to wish my mom a very happy Mother's Day. I know I'm a pain sometimes, but I just want to let you know you've been the best mother anyone could ever hope for. I love you!{% include endmark.html %}
