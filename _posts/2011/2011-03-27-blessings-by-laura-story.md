My new favorite Christian music track is “[Blessings](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/blessings-single/id423917011)” by Laura Story. Here are the lyrics:

> We pray for blessings,  
> We pray for peace,  
> Comfort for family, protection while we sleep.  
> We pray for healing, for prosperity,  
> We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering.  
> All the while, You hear each spoken need,  
> Yet love us way too much to give us lesser things.
> 
> ‘Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?  
> What if Your healing comes through tears?  
> What if a thousand sleepless nights  
> Are what it takes to know You’re near?  
> What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise?
> 
> We pray for wisdom,  
> Your voice to hear,  
> And we cry in anger when we cannot feel You near.  
> We doubt Your goodness, we doubt Your love,  
> As if every promise from Your Word is not enough.  
> All the while, You hear each desperate plea,  
> And long that we’d have faith to believe.
> 
> ‘Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?  
> What if Your healing comes through tears?  
> What if a thousand sleepless nights  
> Are what it takes to know You’re near?  
> And what if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise?
> 
> When friends betray us,  
> When darkness seems to win,  
> We know the pain reminds this heart  
> That this is not, this is not our home.  
> It’s not our home.
> 
> ‘Cause what if your blessings come through raindrops?  
> What if Your healing comes through tears?  
> And what if a thousand sleepless nights  
> Are what it takes to know You’re near?  
> What if my greatest disappointments  
> Or the aching of this life  
> Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can’t satisfy?  
> And what if trials of this life,  
> The rain, the storms, the hardest nights,  
> Are your mercies in disguise?
