![](http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/facebook-no-image-150x150.gif "Facebook default profile photo") So, a few friends tried to contact me to make sure I’m okay since I recently announced I’m going radio silent on Facebook. One friend commented that my message about cleaning up messes was “cryptic” and that I had piqued his interest and left him hanging. I really didn’t mean for my message to be cryptic. If I caught you by surprise or caused you to worry, please forgive me.

By “cleaning up messes” I simply meant that I’m having some time-management difficulties juggling several commitments and Facebook is just a really big timesuck. I could probably manage my Facebook time a little better if I was more self-disciplined, but in this particular situation it seemed more effective to just hit the big red button and go cold turkey for a while. I have every intention of coming back to the Facebook world once I get things a little better organized elsewhere.

While I’m absent from Facebook, you’re welcome to communicate with me using a more ancient form of communication such as a phone call, text message, instant message, e-mail, or even snail mail. If you don’t have my current contact information you are welcome to utilize the [contact form](/contact) on this site to get in touch. I do look forward to hearing from you.
