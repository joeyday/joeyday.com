Someone mentioned to me just the other day that I ought to watch the commencement speech Steve Jobs delivered to the Stanford University class of ’05. So, when I heard the news of his passing today, I decided to find it and watch it. I can’t think of a better way to honor him than by posting it here. It’s fifteen minutes long, but well worth watching.
