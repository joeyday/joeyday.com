When my son was three years old I introduced him to Superman. Superman instantly became his favorite thing. He was a fireman for Halloween the year before, but was Superman three years in a row afterward. We got him several Superman shirts and he was almost always wearing one. We listened to the Superman theme song so many times in my car I got thoroughly sick of it. And that's when I branched out and started compiling a playlist of all superhero theme music.
