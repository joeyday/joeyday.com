        <p>WOW! I started my job at 5 Buck Friday night and in three hours-totalling my wage, tips, and gas reimbursement-I made almost $20 an hour! It’s the easiest job I’ve ever had and it was pretty fun. The only drawback I’m seeing at the moment is that I don’t really get to socialize with my co-workers. Ninety-five percent of my time was spent in my car. I didn’t get lost and I was able to do thirteen deliveries, which I guess is pretty good for my first night. I work there again today so I’ll get to see if Mondays are as good as Friday was.</p>

<p>So now I’m thinking of quitting at Guadalahonky’s. I’m only making minimum wage there and I don’t feel like I’m picking up the job very quickly. I work with a bunch of high school girls and they know what they are doing way better than I do. I just don’t feel like I fit in very well. I would really like to stick around as long as I can and wait for a server position, but if they can’t promote me to server soon, why stay? <img src="/assets/images/endmark.png" class="endmark" /></p>
