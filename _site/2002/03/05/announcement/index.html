        <p>I’m planning a hiking trip up Grandeur Peak this summer. Dates haven’t been finalized, but we’re looking for as many friends as possible. So far the group includes myself, Janene, Stuart, Shilo, Jess, Brian, and Jeremy. If you’d like to be added to the list e-mail me and I’ll keep you updated when we get closer.</p>

<p>So far the plans are as follows: We’ll meet in the afternoon at my house and caravan to the trailhead. The hike up is about two and a half miles. The trail is well-kept and fairly easy going. It only gets a little steeper toward the summit, and is generally a very enjoyable climb. If we time things correctly, we can reach the top 20-30 minutes before the sun sets. This way we get to see the lights in the valley come on. It’ll probably be pretty romantic (if you’re into that sort of thing) so if you want to bring someone along feel free. Then we’ll head back down (another two and a half miles in case you’re wondering) by flashlight. For entertainment, we will be searching for spiders on the way down. We’ll be using a fairly simple technique called ‘Spider Sniffing’. The more people are there, the more fun we’ll have. I know this sounds like ‘Snipe Hunting’. You have to trust me, it’s nothing like that. This is the real deal, but there’s no way I can convince you now; you’ll just have to see it with your own eyes (or smell it with your own nose, so to speak :)). I was skeptical my first time, too.</p>

<p>Everyone will need to bring plenty of water and a flashlight. If you want you can also bring trail mix or Jolly Ranchers; anything for some energy on the hike.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m expecting this trip to be a blast! I’d like to do it early in the summer but anytime that everyone is free will be great. If anyone has a suggestion for a particular weekend let me know. <img src="/assets/images/endmark.png" class="endmark" /></p>
