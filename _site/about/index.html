    <p>Established in 2002 by Joey Day, this is an exercise in critical thinking and writing about Christian theology, apologetics, technology, software engineering, web development, ramen noodles, and whatever other topics strike my fancy.</p>

<p>Joey has been designing websites since 1998, and has been passionate about <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/" title="Standards - W3C">web standards</a> since 2003. In 2008 he got a MacBook and an iPhone and hasn’t looked back. He types on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" title="Dvorak-Dealey “Simplified” Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard</a> (<a href="http://papers.jday.co/view/dvorak" title="“The Myth of Dvorak” by Joey Day">but you shouldn’t</a>) and has been known to dabble in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system" title="Double-entry bookkeeping">double-entry bookkeeping</a> (seriously). Since 2012 he has made his living engineering software on the <a href="http://servicenow.com" title="ServiceNow">ServiceNow</a> platform, at first for a higher-ed non-profit and more recently for a mortgage company.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

Sometimes he writes about Mormonism, but he tries his best to treat the subject with candor and fairness.</p>

<p><img src="http://joeyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/Day-2279.png" alt="Joey &amp; Janene" width="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2495" /> Joey has been married to the charming and beautiful <a href="http://www.janeneday.com" title="Janene Day">Janene Day</a> since 2005 and together they have two adorable kids, a 9-year-old who is too smart for his britches and a 6-year-old who has her daddy wrapped around her little finger. They worship and fellowship at <a href="http://jordanvalleychurch.org/" title="Jordan Valley Church">Jordan Valley Church</a> in West Jordan, Utah.</p>
